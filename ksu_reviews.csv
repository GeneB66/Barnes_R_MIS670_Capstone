"Only in Kansas would 76% white be viewed as ""very diverse"" This school is as country frat boy as it gets. Let's just own it."
"Kansas State was my first choice in schools to transfer to becuase of its family oriented environment. ""EPAW!"" This is the anacronym that best says what Kansas State is about: family, inclusion, diversity and friends. ""Every Person A Wildcat!"" I have embraced this philosophy and made it the philosophy of my life. It has made me happy and introduced and shed new light on how I view life, both my failures and successes. I hope one day that Kansas State will be able to offer scholarships to not only traditional, but also non-traditional students, like myself."
"Amazing! I enjoyed every little thing about it. The food was great. The campus was great, and finally the teacher to student ratio is good.Amazing! I enjoyed every little thing about it. The food was great. The campus was great, and finally the teacher to student ratio is good."
"Kansas State is such an amazing college. Everyone you meet is friendly, and there are so many cool opportunities throughout the college that you are sure to find something to get involved in. The only thing I would change is how they run their housing and dining. It is a mess and they do no communicate well."
"Kansas State University provides a very family, friendly atmosphere. Being a pedestrian based Campus, the community is closer then other Colleges or Universities. The University provides great education and social interactions. The town of Manhattan is a great little place to live, party and study. I have loved everything about being here. It really is a great environment for anybody. Would highly recommend this University to anyone."
"I love how the campus really tries their best to revolve themselves around the idea of family. Even though times get tough and things happen around campus, the community never fails to acknowledge the problem and come back together as one."
i liked how my first visit there i already felt at home and everyone there is so nice and kind and they treated my like family as soon as i stepped on campus.
"Kansas State is a great place to be if you are looking to be in a smaller friendly community. The University is the heart of the town and everyone bleed purple. The sporting events are very well attended especially Saturday football games better know as Caturdays. I feel very safe here and there is plenty of activities from going to the lake or headed to the ""Ville"" to eat or drink. They have every type of bar for any type of crowd. There are many different housing options on campus between dorms, greek houses, and apartments. As well as housing located off campus just blocks away. We have great facilities including the union and rec center. The classrooms are nice and the professors truly get to know you. Class sizes are relatively small which I enjoy. The campus is continually being modernized and 3 of the colleges have been redone in the past 2 years but they still keep the beautiful appearance using the limestone on the buildings. I would recommend this school to anyone!!"
"Upon entering the town of Manhattan, there is purple all over the place and just has a very welcoming and proud feeling. The actual campus itself is very beautiful and there is school colors all around. It has a feeling of a Hogwarts school (for all those harry potter fans). Once I took a step inside of the campus I knew I belonged. I've been to the campus a couple times and the buildings and dorms are all very nice."
The campus is lively and incredibly beautiful! The faculty at Kansas State University is well trained and open with their students. They will always help and put a smile on your face!
"Great place to meet friends, make awesome memories, and proudly be a WILDCAT! The first day of school is easily where you meet most of your friends and connections here on campus, and you wind up feeling like you know a little bit about everyone in just a few short months. The teachers are always so helpful, sweet, and really just want to help their students succeed. They are always approachable. The best part of K-State is knowing you are part of one big family."
The last time I visited K-State the people treated me politely and helped me around the campus. The campus seemed very organized and absolutely beautiful.
It gives me a safe environment to learn. I have many activities and clubs to join to make new friends. The campus is easy to get around in and everything is clean and friendly.
Kansas state university is a great school with many different academic programs to suit any interest.
"Kansas State University has so many options and events going on at all times. The campus is clean and constantly growing and being remodeled. Awesome place to go to school and see homey, Manhattan, Kansas."
"K-State overall is a great school that offers many different educational opportunities for students of all ages. When I first arrived at K-State I had no idea what I wanted to do but within two years I had found my dream. At K-State, there are many teachers, mentors, and advisors that are helpful and willing to work with you."
Very eye opening. Faculty always willing to help out students. Great family vibe student always friendly. There is always something to get involed with. Purple pride GO Cats.
The community surrounding it is very welcoming and friendly. They have great facilities and do collaborations with the military nearby at Ft. Riley. They care about their students and faculty and really try to help you enjoy and succeed.
I have loved my time here! It is a beautiful campus with friendly students. The teachers are willing to help outside of class and I have met my best friends for life here.
Kansas State University is a very diverse university that makes sure to take care of the needs of everyone. The environment is really very serene and pleasant and homely!
"I have had a mostly positive experience at Kansas State. Most of my teachers have been excellent and taught me a lot. It has truly prepared me for me Graduate School I plan to go into. However, many of the older buildings need major remodeling to make them a more comfortable learning environment. There are new buildings being build while some of the older ones have become neglected. Despite this I have enjoyed my time here and feel like it was worth my time and money."
"Kansas State University has so far been a very enjoyable place to continue my education. There are so many different organizations you can be a part of to make your experience more enjoyable. Many of the professors will go above and beyond to help you succeed, which is something that high school teachers said would not happen. And there are also many other resources that are available to students."
"Kansas State University has a great, warm, family oriented community. At Kansas State I have learned that there is something for everyone to get involved in. I have loved every bit of my college experience at Kansas State!"
"Kansas State University is known for its family atmosphere. From my first class to my last, I felt right at home on campus. The professors are approachable and truly care about their students' academic performance."
I like the fact that even though it’s a big campus you don’t have to really walk too far for your classes as well as the fact that it also pretty nice.
Kansas State University is like an Amazing Welcoming Family. One that stands behind you and keeps you going even when you feel like giving up. The campus is small enough to get around and able to make getting between classes easy. The advisers and staff are available to you and guide you through options as well as break down the system so that you can understand what is expected of you.
"When I first stepped foot on this campus I immediately felt at home. There is a family atmosphere that wasn’t at any of the other colleges I looked at. The professors are cool, the classes are fun, and the sporting events are amazing! I am currently a freshman on the rowing team. With that being said, I do get a little bit more things than an average student. I get free tickets to all the football and basketball games, amazing breakfast and dinner, and I’ve made amazing friends. If you’re a student athlete or just a student, definitely come to K-State."
"Friendly environment, safe, good professors and research. Opportunities for student research and jobs, and a safe and friendly surrounding community. Many resources for every student."
"I am located at Kansas State Polytechnic, which is in Salina, ks. While yes its not main campus it is a very nice facility that has helped me chase my dream of becoming an Airline Pilot."
Very Loving and caring schools that genuinely cares about the students that attend both academically and emotionally
I am an incoming freshman who has been visiting the campus for the last four years for FFA. Everyone is so nice there and the campus is beautiful. Im so excited to become a Wildcat this fall!
"Kansas State University has been my home away from home for three years now. The environment is beyond welcoming and friendly. In fact, a common phrase that you hear from high school seniors and juniors coming on tours here is, ""Everyone is so friendly here.""
This place gave me the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and join Greek life. The Greek life on campus is unique in that we are all a community that roots for one another, but still competes hard for the coveted Homecoming 1st Place Win."
I loved the atmosphere of the campus and the dedication by all of the staff to ensure you get the highest quality education.
"Kansas State is a family, we have a beautiful campus, national ranked sports teams, have great programs, and ranked the best college town in the country"
"Coming in as a transfer student I felt so welcomed by the people at Kanas State University. Everyone was so nice and wanted to get to know me, which made me feel like a part of the purple family from the start."
"This is a great school! The teachers are great and seem eager to teach. The dorms are the great as well lots of nice people to get alone with, K state is like a big happy family. Also the food is pretty great, I would say I never go hungry here at K state. But the biggest importance in my opinion is that this school is one of the safest schools I have ever been to."
"I go to KSU online (Global Campus) and I love it! It provides the flexibility I need as a new mother and all the teachers I have had thus far are very good at what they do! I will say that you have to be self-motivated to get through your work. Your teacher is not reminding you of assignments due, etc like you'd find on campus."
"While touring the campus, the students were all very friendly and outgoing, while offering to help in any way they could. The campus is small and perfect. The library is amazing; with moving shelves and the Harry Potter Great Hall study room, there are resources that are ready to be utilized."
I so far have loved K-State all the friendships that I have made are ones that I will remember and cherish forever. The environment is also so welcoming and friendly.
"I love K-State. It's not just propaganda when they say that we are family. Everyone has so much pride for the school that you can't help but love almost anyone you meet. Things are easy to locate, professors are kind and there are so many ways to get involved!"
"The atmosphere at K-State is very down to Earth. Everyone is always willing to help or talk. It's a Division 1 school but on a smaller campus, and a small town feel. There is always something to do and the football games are always legendary. Kansas State University is a pretty good school, but average on a grand scale."
"Family. That is what I felt when I visited Kansas State. Everyone at K-State was super friendly and made you feel at home. There is no other college in the nation that will make you feel like you are at home when you walk on campus and meet the people of Manhattan. It is no wonder why the football team walks into the game with a piece of wood that says, family. I highly recommend this college to anyone looking for a high quality education with many opportunities for future success."
"Kansas State University (KSU) has been an amazing experience for me! The school is large, but it still has that close knit family feeling. My favorite part about the KSU are the professors. They go above and beyond to meet their students needs. All the academic help is just outstanding! This was so important my freshmen year since I was so far away from home and needed that extra time and attention in order to figure this new life out!"
"K-State is a great school. Most of the professors are very good and very helpful; however, i feel that courses are at times extremely easy and are not challenging enough."
"Kansas State is a wonderful place. I originate from a small town in Kansas and was worried about being overwhelmed, but luckily Kansas State is a fairly big city, with a small town feel. Everyone is kind and super friendly. The dorms are a wonderful place to meet new people, get help on homework, and always finding a way to get connected."
"They have great programs that will really help me advance my education, and everyone I have talked to has been super helpful."
"Everything i had experienced at K-State on my first semester there was amazing. I'm an International student and when i first came to k-state i was a little scared about the culture, the university and more. But i soon realized the amazing eviroment and people that are at k-state. The academic was amazing except for 2 english classes that they required me to take and i didn't need to, but besides that i would highly recommend this university to everyone."
"I love how open and welcoming Kansas State is, although I would like to see more diversity. The faculty is in general very easy to get along with. Most professors really do want to see you succeed and are easy to talk to."
I have loved the atmosphere at K-State. It really does feel like family and the help I get from professors has been so appreciated!
I like the fact I can become my own person and I do not approve of the gun law that they pass for the campus.
"The school environment is bad. There is not a lot to do in the area. The party scene is dead. It is very expensive for out of state students, but they have an very good aviation program."
"I am not yet attending Kansas State University but the two tours I have been on (both junior and senior years of high school) proved to me right away that the school was the right place for me. Anyone you met was genuinely kind and friendly, they were also direct and easy to ask for help. The students around campus that I spoke with were helpful and easy going. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. Something important that they have is a 24 hour tutoring building for students who need help whenever they need it. I had a chance to speak with the main professor of my major (Economics) and he was glad to set up an appointment to talk to me about the major and what I could expect from the college course itself. The majority of students don't meet their professors until they get to college and are usually an unfamiliar face, so meeting the professor really impressed me. I would recommend Kansas State to anyone I know, in or out of state."
"I have loved attending KSU, have made wonderful friends, and am getting a great education. The school is great about helping make sure we get what we need. I am working on getting an internship, and the availability of companies has been impressive. My classes are hard, but I am learning! I am anxious to start my career in architectural engineering."
"Coming into college as a first generation student, I didn’t really know what to expect. If I did have any expectations, I know for a fact that K-State would surpass them. I have been surrounded by nothing but support and friendliness. They aren’t kidding when they say that K-State is a family. I see a new person on campus every day and everyone always has a smile on their face. Every employee on campus are all really nice and are always willing to help."
"Overall, KSU is a nice university. I just wish there was more diversity, so other races can feel more welcomed. Academically, I appreciate the professors and how well they know the material and are so willing to help me receive a better meaning of the understanding. The area surrounding the campus is very nice and I feel safe. I would recommend others to become a K-State Wildcat."
I loved how welcome I felt as soon as I stepped onto the campus. I felt like I was at home within my first month of living there!
I enjoy the atmosphere on campus very much. I came from a small town and had an easy transition to college. I feel safe on campus and there are a bunch of fun activities I’m involved in that make my college experience fantastic.
"It may seem very cliché but I really do feel that Kansas State University is one big family. There are about 24,000 students; however, there is not a place on campus that I do not run into someone I know. The diverse student population allows me to meet new friends daily. In addition, I believe the professors at K-State are a huge asset to the University. They care about their students’ careers, goals, and life outside of their courses. I feel very confident that I could talk to any of my professors about my personal life and they would be willing to help through any issues or point me towards resources."
"So far, I have only had good experiences at KSU. The professors work hard to ensure a good education is obtained by the students and the university as a whole works to improve student life and resources."
I had a great time visiting Kansas State University. K-State had many opportunities for freshmen entering. I liked how diverse the school was. One thing I would change is transportation. Like school buses to get you to places faster around the campus.
"Friendly environment, willing to meet people from all different kinds of backgrounds. The environment is very welcoming and makes the campus, although big, feel like we are at a small school because of the close-knit community. It's an easy walk from each building and you can get practically anywhere by foot. The town is comfortable to live in and Aggieville makes Manhattan feel like home."
"What I have liked most about Kansas State University is the sense of community and family among faculty, staff, and students."
"K-State is the perfect college. Great academics with a focus on research; great sports emphasis thanks to Bill Snyder; awesome town full of fun, local restaurants and shops; and a great community filled with great people!"
"It was great! Price was outrageous, though. Thanks, LBJ. There was a great sense of community and academics. I would love to spend more time there."
"They were very accommodating and friendly all around the campus providing help and directions. K-State is known all around for an influential Vet and engineering program providing only the very best for their students. The campus is beautiful drawing comparisons to Hogwarts. Their athletics programs especially their football team, is nationally ranked almost every year. K-State specifically placed around 50 black-lights around their campus providing safety for the students if they ever felt scared. K-State is easily the best college in Kansas if not the country. EMAW for life."
"Just like every relationship, Kansas State has its ups and downs. Like most colleges, Kansas State definitely has its hardships. Where studying becomes the priority and exams aren't easy. When the studying pays off it's always a reward, but that's not where the relationship starts. The relationship starts with the town of Manhattan. It's a beautiful and active town filled with scenery, colors, amazing people, and a night life like none other. Where the beauty doesn't stop and flows right into campus bringing such a power and caring community filled with college pride. Here at K-State I've met many people all of which I wish I thank them more. Where from student to staff they are very caring and inspiring, so kind you can't stop it from changing your overall happiness, the blessing it is."
"I really enjoy the atmosphere and the people, including the professors but the dorms are not the best in the world."
Such a great school with so many friendly people and a small town feel within a mid sized town. My number one choice for college at such a great price.
When we say we are the K-State family we mean it. Everyone is friendly and kind and so welcoming. I wouldn't want to be going to school anywhere else.
"There is a sense of family at this campus. Everyone stands together for one another, including students and faculty."
This summer I went to visit this campus. The university is beautiful with the pretty old buildings. Right outside of the campus there is much to do.
I enjoy the college experience that I have at K-State. I wish that the food for the meal plans would improve.
"I chose Kansas State due to the family environment. Family is such a strong word to K-State - Its used in attraction for our university, written on a wooden plank and held high during football games. It has a hometown environment and feeling, making Kansas State a genuine and lovable university."
"Kansas State is a great place to go to, it has a lot of scenery and it's really spacious. Athletics is great (Minus the fact that it doesn't have a swim team and the basketball team is OK) Parties are pretty wild. But everyone is nice."
"I enjoyed the feeling I get when I'm on campus. Everyone is kind and helpful! I haven't met a full-time professor that I haven't been able to talk to and be comfortable in their class. Everyone here truly is invested in your success and wants to see you live the best life you can on this campus. There is a large lack in diversity and with the recent problems with racial violence through posters up around campus and various social media scandals, I feel that this place is becoming less safe for minority students, which is a huge problem. The administration finds it hard to admit there are any problems and thus keep it off their hands in return for the hatred to still be present on campus. I hope they begin to sit up a little bit more on the real issues happening on campus."
Kansas State University is awesome. I really like the environment and the people at the university. I like all of the resources K-State offers for the students. My favorite part of K-State is the willingness to help one another. K-State is a very good school overall and highly recommend it to friends and family.
"Though K-State is a large public university and felt overwhelming to me when I transferred from a much smaller school, I've found the professors very open to connecting with students and working to provide them the best opportunities possible. There are diverse opportunities for study and an equally diverse community of students. The school is in a rather politically conservative area, but dialogue between different perspectives is being supported on campus."
"I like that everyone at Kansas State University is friendly. I also like K-States motto which is ""Family."""
"The campus has a friendly atmosphere and great scenery. The classes are easy to get to because the campus well organized. The advisers are very knowledgeable and helpful. Most of the classes are well prepared and packed with information. The professors I've had take their jobs seriously. The only downside is that there is a lot of construction, and it has impacted school fees."
I have loved my experience so far!! The community is amazing! The resources are some of the best I've experienced! Everyone feels like family at KSU. I love attending all sports games and activities! Amazing college experience!
The campus is beautiful and everybody there (students and faculty) are all very kind. There is a very nice family-feeling on campus. There are many research opportunities for students as well as many study programs and majors to choose from.
Everyone is so respectful and care about there different cultures they have all around their university.
"Kansas State is an awesome University. Highly underrated. There's a family feel on campus, everyone makes you feel welcome. Manhattan is a small town, yet can feel somewhat urbanized, which is amazing. The academics are the most underrated part of Kstate! I say we are one of the best in the Midwest at least! The students from urban areas tend to be heavy liberal, while the rural kids are more moderate to conservative. Overall it's about as liberal as any other midwest campus is! Very diverse for a college 2 hours out from a major urban center!"
"I love Kansas state. such a great atmosphere and family. People are so genuine and kind while walking through campus. Traditions are amazing, campus is beautiful, its overall the best place to be!"
"I absolutely love K-State! Everyone is nice, the professors are there for you when you need them. The school campus is beautiful. The university is in a safe environment."
This an overall fantastic university for any out-of-state student. Students are friendly and extremely involved in organizations and the well being of the University. The only thing I would improve is campus safety and I would love to see Kansas State University financially contribute to the City of Manhattan more than they already do.
"Kansas State University, to me, has a feeling connected with it that drew me in. I liked that every time when I was looking into which college I wanted to attend KSU was the one college where I felt like I already fit in, that I was a present student. KSU offers many different majors to fit all sorts of interests of their students, as well as many different on-campus clubs and organizations to become a part of. To me, Kansas State University wants each student to have the best experience possible during their time at there."
"After just one year of attending school here, I already love it! The friendly atmosphere, teachers who care about you, and the friends you make are just some of the many things I love about K-State. Everyone wants you to succeed and to make sure you're doing well. The friends I've made so far I know will be around for a lifetime!"
"I loved that every professor that I encountered, no matter the class size, was genuinely concerned about whether their students were learning or not. Every one encouraged setting up appointments with them and asking questions. I was also very please with my stay in the dorms my freshman year; there was not a moment that I felt unsafe or that they did not exceed my expectations. Finally, I love K-State because we truly are a huge family. Someone, whether you know them personally or not, is always there to reach out to or is there to share a smile."
everyone is very friendly and happy to help. clean environment and they all seem to really care about your education
"Overall, K-State is incredible. There is a broad diversity of opinion and culture within the student body that culminates in a family-like community. You get the small-town vibes while still being surrounded by anything and everything you could need. Epitome of the midwest culture."
"Kansas State University is very diverse. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved in protests, clubs/organizations, internships, work study jobs, and sports. The campus is easily navigable but the parking is a little troublesome from time to time. Many of the professors will email back quickly to questions and have office hours to help you whenever problems should arise. The one major flaw with K-State is how hard it is to get financial aid. The financial aid department will make it seem like you have all of these K-State scholarships to apply for with a packet but as it turns out, you are NOT actually applying for the scholarships but for a couple small state given grants. K-State is still amazing to go to but definitely search elsewhere for the funds."
I had an amazing time at K-State. The community is amazing and making new friends is an easy task. There are tons of organizations to get involved in and mark your mark on the campus. while not all teachers are what you had expected most of them are great and will help you to succeed as much as they can.
I love Kansas State University. The campus is beautiful and all the buildings are close to each other. People are so nice around campus and the professors are excellent. I can't imagine going to any other school.
Overall the university is a good school and the academic programs are outstanding. It's a smaller university but a great learning environment
"I truly believe that this is a great and amazing school and everyone should come to the campus and get a tour of this school. There are so many friendly students and staff that will be willing to help you if you ever get lost, i visited this school and everyone i meet was so welcoming and friendly and polite. As soon as i entered the campus i knew that this school was going to be a great pick for me and there is so much opportunities here. The games are also great as well everyone is so enthusiastic about their school and they are not afraid to show it!"
What I loved about Kansas State University is the diversity of the students. I also loved that our campus was safe and there was little crime. Professors were always willing to assist if the need arose. The overall experience of being a K-State student was amazing.
"I enjoy the University and the programs/services that are offered to assist students academically. One thing I would change would be the quality of the buildings that certain departments reside in. There are certain programs that have top of the line buildings and others, a great deal of others, that have very low quality buildings. These low quality buildings inhibit students from achieving their true potential and inhibit professors as well. `"
I really enjoy that KSU holds the same values as me. At KSU they make you feel like family. So coming from a large family myself and being embraced by the KSU family was very encouraging. KSU has allowed me the chance to follow my passion of studying agriculture with its amazing department of ag.
"Kansas State is overall a great University. The people here are all so nice to each other, and it really is a ""family"" atmosphere. The professors are super helpful, and it is really easy to get involved with things on campus and make friends. Things are even better when the athletics are doing good!"
As an out of state student I was very nervous going into my freshman year at Kansas State but the University is absolutely wonderful! I did not live in dorms my first year and was still integrated and was highly involved! Everyone on campus is very welcoming and helpful! I am absolutely in love with this school and I am so thankful for taking the big leap and going out of state.
Everytime I went to visit KSU the people were fantastic. I have never felt more comfortabel at a university than I did when I was at K-State.
I love Kansas State University. It has all the feel of a small town tight nit community while still being large enough to all you to meet all kinds of new people and do exciting new things. Everyone is welcoming and the staff are always willing to help out students.
I have had a wonderful experience so far at K-State. I am a non-traditional student and they have been so helpful and made going back to school a seamless process. They are always willing to find the answers and guide you in the right direction.
I have enjoyed my time here. Great professors and great people in my department. The classes were hard and time-consuming. Dorm food is awful but local food is awesome.
K-state has provided me with the greatest opportunity to grow as a person. The family atmosphere makes me never want to graduate.
"Kansas State University has a very pretty campus and a wide variety of classes. However, some classes are too big and make it hard to concentrate in. There are a lot of activities students can get involved in as well as a diverse number of students. The recreation center is amazing as well as Kramer Dining Center. The dorms are spacious and friendly. I feel very safe on campus and there is always something to do outside of class around town."
"Salina campus is a small campus, quiet. Class sizes are very small so it's quite easy to set up or get a hold of professors or instructors. Flight program is good but you have to adopt to Kansas weather, WINDY!"
It's a great school where I've had many memorable experiences already. The facilities are fairly dated - which is my only real concern about the school.
My favorite thing about Kansas State is the Family atmosphere on campus. Everyone is very friendly and willing to stop and help if you are lost or need help. One thing I would like to see changed at Kansas State is that some of the professors in my major are bad but somehow have tenure while the good professors who are willing to interact and really help students don't have tenure. We fill out teaching evaluations every semester but it seems like the department doesn't take the students suggestions seriously.
I really enjoy the atmosphere and the culture surrounding K-State. I feel like I am truly a part of the Wildcat family! KSU only hires top of the line professors who have a genuine interest in their student's success.
"I absolutely love Kansas State University. The family atmosphere here is out of this world. I feel as though this is where I belong and there is always something for me to be apart of. I have met some of my closest friends here that I believe I will have forever. Also, the professors are very involved in your success and cannot wait to see you become some bigger part of society. GO CATS!"
"I love the people and the atmosphere. I lived in the residence halls two years and really enjoyed it. It was a great way to make friends and connect with other students. I also work on campus, which is really convenient and the people are great. Most of my classes have been really helpful and the teachers are willing to help if you need it. Overall, I really enjoy my time here, but it is expensive. I have had some good scholarships that have helped though."
"I love K-State! My family has a long history of being Wildcats, and I am glad I got to carry on the tradition. However, having come from out of state was still daunting. I had not known anyone when I came to college, but the k-State Family pulled through. While it may sound extremely cheesy, I really do think that this school is as close to a family as a state school can be. I never walk to class without seeing at least one person I know and everywhere I go I'm greeted with smiles and waves. The pride in K-State is also pretty amazing. On any given day more than 40% of the people on campus are wearing purple. It is truly an amazing school!"
I grew up in the Kansas state area and i loved it. I was connected through all the sports departments and got to meat big time players. Also the campus life because I had cousins that attended college there.
Love the family feel here. Everyone is super friendly and I feel very welcome here. All of the professors and staff I have dealt with have been great. Go cats!
"My first year was hard. Loved it above all else. I'm looking forward to being back home for summer. Being 700 miles away from my parents and sister was hard, but I was closer to my grandparents for holidays! Amazing marching band - Go PRIDE! I love my choice of going out of state. EMAW!"
"K-State is a fine school. Everyone's college experience is different. So far, mine has been okay. There are a lot of on-campus organizations and activities."
"Kansas State University is a place that turns friends, coworkers, and peers into family. Here at Kansas State, we do things the ""Wildcat Way"". To me, this means making connections, helping others feel welcome, and simply holding a door open for someone. I am so grateful for what Kansas State has done for me, especially the advising staff. Being someone who had an idea of what they wanted to do, but was not sure how, I have received so much guidance from the advising staff. The people at Kansas State University truly and genuinely care, and it shows."
"The dreams of a high school girl, I brought to the hallways of McCain.As a music major, I was fortunate to have educators that always made it clear that you should expect more of yourself and rise to the occcassion because in the end it's those good people that are going to conquer the world. Proudly I was a part of the The Pride Kansas State University Marching Band recipients of The Sudler Trophy. 5 years I Wabashed, high stepped, rolled stepped and cried from exhaustion my freshman from 12 hrs days at band camp in the sweltering heat. I also laughed so hard I couldn't catch my breath. Unbeknownst to me, I learned what it meant to truly work hard and have pride in what I put that work into. The value of integrity and the makings of a future Kansas State graduate that is beyond appreciative of the candidness and passion I've come to expect from all educators on behalf of those set by my own professors who trusted in the value of investing in their students wholeheartedly."
"I recommend Kansas State University to anyone looking for an open campus with lots of stuff to do. There is never a day without a lecture, event or something interesting going on. It’s always nice to take a walk around campus and see the beautiful buildings. I would recommend living in a dorm for your first semester and then deciding from there if you want to stay in the dorms or find an apartment or hours to rent out. This is also true about meal plans. I would recommend trying a meal plan for the first year or so, then decide from there if you want to continue with it. The best part about Kstate is the community and willingness for people to help you out no matter what."
Kansas State University is a very open and diverse campus with lots of different people and opportunities. They are welcoming to everyone and the people are all very friendly.
I love the atmosphere of K-State and all the opportunities it offers! I couldn't image going anywhere else!
I love Kansas State University. It is a great environment and full of friendly people. The teachers are helpful and make classes interesting and there are many options to help you succeed.
Kansas state university this is one of the universities that are extremely easy to get around on. The campus is easy to remember and everything is close for a college this size. There is always plenty to around campus so don't expect to be bored!
There is a high amount of diversity within Kansas State University. I would consider it a very friendly and personable school.
"Very good school overall. Be very careful with your class selections though. If your major has multiple disciplines within it, make sure the classes you take the first 2 years can apply to all of them. Or you'll end up taking a class that doesn't crossover and it can tank your GPA if you didn't do well in it. Very beautiful campus, student housing on campus is pretty good, off campus housing can get a bit pricey though"
"KSU is a great community, but not cohesive with education today. Too many professors are either learning on the go, or sticking to the same routine, with no in-between. They need to find a happy middle."
I have received great help at K-State. My academic advisor is amazing and can always point me in the right direction. I've come across some major difficulties and received a lot of help from campus resources. Almost all of the teachers I've had have been incredible!
Kansas State has such an amazing family atmosphere that you do not want to miss out on. The faculty is amazing here and will do anything in their power to make sure you have the proper accommodations that are needed for your success here at K-State. The community of Manhattan is also an amazing place to live and has plenty of options for food and entertainment.
The family atmosphere is the best thing here. When you get here you are welcomed with open arms and everyone gets along. But more diversity would be better just to mix things up.
"When people describe Kansas State University as one big family, they sure mean it. Everywhere you go there are kind faces willing to help if you need it. I have enjoyed my classes and my professors. They want to see you succeed."
"With some family members went to K-State, I say it runs in the family. Also now with our generation, me and one of my brothers are attending K-State (my brother already attends there, I'm fall 2017). I feel that it is a school that would help into the future and more generations to come to help us build to be a stronger and more stable family of K-State."
I am enjoying my experience at Kansas State. I wouldn't change a thing. The community is so strong and the professors truly care about you.
"I love the way the campus feels small and homey, even though there are 20,000+ students there. The new space in the engineering building is awesome and the faculty is very helpful."
"KSU is a great college, especially when everyone are very nice. The professors actually give some care on students. There are a lot of resources available to students. For example, there's tutoring for almost every class and is available on weekends as well. I feel safe on campus, even at night. The library have multiple levels for students to study comfortably."
"Great experience, had a great time here, weekends are fun, classes are cool, dorms are nice, made lots of friends, would highly recomend"
"Kansas State is a wonderful university. I highly recommend it. I transferred here after my Freshman year of college and I do not regret it! All of the teachers and staff are highly trained and always willing to do whatever it takes to help you succeed. Also, everybody here is super nice and friendly. The university is located in Manhattan, Kansas. It's the perfect college town. Everything you need is within a 10 minute drive. I personally love the atmosphere of the campus and the town, everybody bleeds K-State purple and it fills you with pride. The academics are astounding and the sporting events are so much fun! Every football game is sold out because the town genuinely loves and supports the University all that much, it makes me proud to call this place home. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else."
I pretty much love everything about K-State. I love the feeling that its a small campus. Everyone that goes to K-State is so friendly and always smiles.The only thing that bothers me is that there is still construction. I am ready not to have any construction workers on my campus!
"I was on the polytech campus in salina, it is a small, safe campus; more men than women but every one looks out for each other. staff is very helpful and it is easy to find people with similar interests."
Kstate is a great university to be at. Everyone is so welcoming and kind. You will find the most genuine people here and it is honestly the happiest place on Earth.
"I absolutely am in love with this school! I feel like I am apart of one huge family here. There is a space for everyone that goes here. The school spirit is huge here and almost everyone participates in events. The teachers I've had really care about the students and want their students to succeed. They also are all very passionate about what they teach. There are also many places that you can study or get help, like tutors and what not."
"Kansas State University welcomes incoming students with open arms, encompassing a warm environment for all to learn. Despite tuition being a bit overpriced for out of state and international students, I would gladly recommend K-State for anyone wishing to go there to pursue their education."
"Beautiful campus, great teachers. They do not care much about harassment of females and don't do much to prevent against it, however the groups on campus and the women's center are wonderful."
Kansas State University is the best school I have been to I am a multicultural student and its a great community in the school.
"My experience at Kansas State University has been great so far. Coming in as a freshman there were many opportunities to get involved and learn more about our school. I made the decision to be apart of a sorority and I couldn't be happier. As an Asian-American student, one thing I would like to see improve on our campus would be the diversity."
"Beautiful campus with plenty of room. Friendly, helpful professors but could hire more so that students can have scheduling flexibility for more classes. Many campus activities and great sports teams."
"I absolutely love Kansas State! beautiful campus first and now I love just about everything about it. the classes can are difficult and stressful, but there are so many resources for you to go to and get help. Campus is completely safe.. the only problem is that it's a small city but the people around are very friendly"
I have loved my time at K-State. It has a small town feel while still being a large college. We are truly a big happy purple family and that can be felt all around campus.
Kansas state is a developing campus that we are seeing improve every day. The new buildings are wonderful and a joy to have classes in. The downside is the large amount of construction going on. If you are a student there is always something you can get involved with and plenty going on in Aggieville on the weekends. There is nothing quite like Gameday in the Little Apple and I don't regret going to K-State for a minute.
I love K-State! It is a great school with a great atmosphere. If you work hard you will get rewarded for sure. Get out and experience things within the university and you will have more doors open to you.
Kansas State University is a family oriented college that has made me feel as if I was home from day one.
"I liked the class room. It did seem like much, but I actually would like being there. Though I wouldn't mind an upgrade to the elevators to the dorms."
"I really enjoyed my dorm experience. K-State gives you the opportunity to find a roommate online and get to know them so you can decide if you'll work well together or not. I did that and I love my roommate!

There are also a lot of free tutoring opportunities and I haven't heard a single complain about them."
"Going to school here has been one of the best decisions that I have made in my short life span. I have met many great people during my time, learned more than I thought I could have ever learned in such a short time. The professors are amazing, they will go out of their way to make sure you learn the content even if the class is a 200 person lecture hall. For as big as the school and campus is, you still get this small town feel and everyone treats everyone like family around here. It's amazing."
I plan on attending this school in the fall of 2017. When I visited I fell in love. I can tell that every student here feels as if they are part of a big family. The campus is beautiful and Manhattan itself is such a great city.
"I really love KSU's slogan of family, I love the traditions at the games. I love our infrastructure how it looks like castles. I love that we have really good professors who genuinely want to help, what could change is maybe the resources on campus for people of color and other minorities. I'm not one myself but I know with the recent election, my friends will need it."
Amazing faculty and clubs. Challenging course work that allows one to prepare for jobs in the workforce. Downside is the lack of diversity and cultural sensitivity towards minorities.
I love that K-State really feels like a welcoming family and has a ton of options for whatever your interests may be.
"The college is really just a big family. Granted, there are people that you don't always like, but the atmosphere is amazing. There is a lot of fun things to do and a whole lot of options to help keep your studies in order and on track. The professors are willing to help you out with anything you need within reason and are really good at what they do."
K-State University is an amazing school with an incredibly positive atmosphere. Manhattan is a beautiful little town with a lot to do for people of all ages.
I like the people in Manhattan. They are very nice and respectful. Aggieville is a lot of fun. I wish their campus was a bit nicer.
This university really feels a lot smaller than it actually is. People are constantly smiling and saying hi to strangers. Walking campus and getting the physical exercise that way is 100% worth it because the campus is absolutely stunning. It's a great place to be and the people really care about you individually.
The campus is great and the people are so friendly. There are no strangers at KSU. They have a huge variety of classes to take and many majors to choose from so you don't have to transfer if you switch majors or minors. The atmosphere is great in the classroom and out of it. I'm so glad I choose Kansas state university as my college home.
"From my first visit of the campus I fell in love. The small and quiet town was definitely the right atmosphere for me. There are tons of resources available free of charge, with several tutoring locations. Professors and TA's are always willing to help and will respond to your needs in a timely manner."
"I love my classes. One professor was different at first, but once I went and talked to him in his office things got significantly better. Other than that everything is very positive!"
The career center here is phenomenal! They do an excellent job. The career fair is also a huge help.
I have always felt safe and no harm
I am not a part of one.
Tailgating at football games is some of the best experiences of my life!!
Getting involved in clubs have allowed me new leadership opportunities and new friendships. The campus here is absolutely beautiful. I like the fact I am not afraid to ask for help or any questions because the teachers and staff here are literally like family.
Professors truly care about what they're teaching and you can see the dedication
SO many opportunities to work on campus
"Great programs put in place, and a mandatory informational class is needed"
Wefald is a great dorm and the rooms are so spacious
"The philanthropy events are great, and there's always some sorority/ frat helping the community"
"K-State is very welcoming, and a great school to begin your journey at!"
They have personal trainers or even trainers that you can work with in a group. They have several workout machines and a huge basketball/ volleyball court. They have an outdoor facility that has tennis and things like that. They are very friendly and don't mind helping others with working the machines and they keep it very clean in there.
They have great dedicated teachers that are helpful and friendly. They also have a class where you can learn about all the opportunities they have and were you van get a job and things like that. They are very friendly here and they do all types of events and get together and they invite eveeryone.
All of my professors so far have been very understanding and seem to have a big passion for what they're doing.
All of my professors so far have been very understanding and seem to have a big passion for what they're doing.
"We have a lot of safety measures put in place, like Cat Walk and various others."
"My time is the dorms was really well spent, I met a lot of great people!"
"Greek life is pretty exclusive, but it is a big part of campus."
We have some of the best fans in the country! Varsity sporting events are highly attended and enjoyed.
My school really does feel like a family and my favorite thing is how friendly everyone is.
"Parties are available, but you do not feel like you are forced to attend. People are generally friendly and it is a good way to meet people."
"There are plenty of options in Aggie-ville, and the fraternities offer parties also. Many houses offer designated drivers."
The course offerings are many and varied. A person can get a well-respected degree here. The professors are very good and willing to work with students one-on-one as needed.
"I see people of all races and colors on campus. We are probably not as diverse as say a Chicago or New York school, but for the midwest, there are a good mix of all peoples. Clubs, fraternities and organizations are open to everyone."
The professors in my program are very helpful and invested in the students.
My program has several networking opportunities and travel opportunities so we are well acclimated in the field when we graduate.
We have sereval services to keep people safe on campus including emergency blue piles that are everywhere and will light up and alert police if pushed.
"The dorms are either great or not. I e heard and seen great things about haymaker, but I was in ford which is and all girls dorm and it is not fun and cliquey."
"I just joined this year and although recruitment was stressful, it's been good so far!"
Everyone loves football games and they are usually always sold out. Our football team comes out with s sign everything with a sign that says family because it's true!
Great family atmosphere and everyone is very friendly
"I adore the sense of community I get from K-State. No matter how busy everyone seems, all one needs to do is ask and people will try to help you the best they can. I will admit that I do not have any experience in the party scene, so my scores are only based on rumor."
"Great college for engineering! The campus is clean and ever expanding, there are plenty of living choices such as dorms, frats, apartments. The professors are generally very friendly, and the major specific courses are challanging and deep. Plus tuition is recently priced at the time of writing this review. The only major gripe is with the freshman starter classes. They are not kind on people new to the college experience. Though, to be completely honest, this isn't too bad, as many universities nowadays put too much focus on keeping students paying, rather than suceeding."
Kansas State University is great! I really love the atmosphere and the students here are always very energetic and fun to be around.
"The classes are average on quality. I would say it depends on what you are interested in. I have so far liked all my professors, even the ones that are tougher and not as outgoing as the others. I like the different class sizes and not always being stuck in a large lecture or a small classroom."
My program is one of the top ranked Architecture programs in the United States. I think any degree from Kstate would be very valuable. The alumni is very involved here and theres even a program specifically for current students to interact with alumni.
"I have been at this school for 2 weeks and I have not witnessed, or heard about anything happening to anyone, or anyone feeling unsafe. I feel very safe on campus but naturally like to find a friend to walk with on the late nights."
"The dorm life is fun and it is nice to be near so many people who are doing the same things that you are doing. It is somewhat far from all my classes, but not everyone has that problem."
"Greek life makes the campus a little cliquey, but I am not involved in greek life and all my friends are. I do sometimes feel left out but my friends don't treat me any different."
The students at K-State all love supporting the sports teams and have a lot of school spirit. The Bill Snyder Family Stadium is beautiful and the environment on game days is great.
I like how nice and helpful the upperclassmen were whenever I was lost on campus. I would always pick K-State and recommend it to others.
The course material is challenging but professors are their if assistants is needed.
"There are a plentiful number of jobs, internships, and career experience on campus."
This campus is safe. There are panic buttons and apps that can help people who feel threaten.
I live in Jardine Apartments and it has spacious rooms and overall extremely nice.
I am not apart of the Greek life but I do get treated differently.
The football team here is a huge part of campus life.
There are a lot of activities to do every single day.
This is a great place to prepare for and find a career.
"Experience varies greatly, but I like most of my professors and enjoy the classes I get to take."
There aren't any big issue that I know about.
"It depends where and what you choose, but I feel like more could be done to improve the value."
"Sports are a pretty big thing, but only certain sports of a certain gender."
"because it fun to be in college and my career is engineering. like it the right college i want to go. to study more, to learn more about engineering."
"Hated my first semester, but I met some cool friends and now I love coming back!"
I prefer to live off campus
Very clicky and awful people
career progression is an important topic all over campus
I would not have had the same experience anywhere else
Kansas state promotes health and safety and informs their students
"I don't personally live on campus, but my friends seem to enjoy it."
The Greek Life is very involved in the community and on campus
They encourage being physically fit on campus
"This school has made my transition from Army Active Duty to a full time college student a smooth process, and I couldn't have been as successful anywhere else."
"School spirit is important, and once you're a wildcat, you're ALWAYS a wildcat!"
"Very welcoming and a great place to study, great location"
"Indifferent, i dont really pay attention to them, but there is a big party life within."
"Football Games are what everyone lives for, its not often people dont go to a game. Spirit with students, fans, and players is always high."
Very community based and plenty of opportunities for students
Over all the experience is pretty great. The community is unreal and there is literally something for everyone. Each student is pretty excepting of the other student and there is rarely any tension. There is housing and dinning options for everyone. Overall very accommodating.
There are many programs and resources available to students. There are programs to help with resumes and to lead you into the next step after school. There are plenty of alumni who are very successful. There are plenty of resources to find part time jobs and internships.
"There are plenty of programs to help escort you to classes, especially evening classes, and there emergency blue lights placed everywhere on campus."
"Pretty average housing. You get what you put into it, obviously there are nicer buildings and the newer ones reflect that."
"I can't speak much into it, but there is a wide variety of Greek life to choose from."
Sports are a big part of our school and bring everyone together.
"The majority of students are super engaging and welcoming, there is something for everyone, it's like a big family."
"On campus there are 14 sororities and almost 30 fraternities. Greek life is a large part of the social life a student can have on campus but the campus does not let Greek life be the only opportunity on campus to have a social life. There are many, many campus clubs to be involved in too. All around though if one is involved in Greek life I think non-Greeks are accepting of Greeks and visa versa. One of the advantages of being Greek though is having the ""family"" experience a lot sooner than non-Greeks."
"The athletics at K-State is really great. There are subpar facilities provided for everyone on campus. There are activities provided for the most elite all the way to recreational fun levels of athletes. For example, I am not into sports very much at all but at the recreation conter there are activities such as ping pong, badminton, dance classes and more provided for me to still stay active and have fun!"
"K-State is really fantastic because of it academics, it's students and it's learning atmospheres. I have not had one bad experience or heard of any student complain because the school does not care. The family atmosphere is tremendous considering the school is so large but seems so small. If I could do it all over I would choose the same path I have at K-State. I have met the most inspiring friends and teachers at the university and hope others who join the K-state family can too experience this feeling."
Huge school was not expecting this when I stepped on campus I'm loving it so far.
K-State is where I feel the most at home. I've met amazing people and learned more than I ever have before. I actually am excited for school to start.
"K-State is very respected and almost every graduate can find a job in their field. You have to be realistic about the economy and what your major is though, liberal arts degrees may have a hard time while engineers are highly sought after. You can talk with your advisor and other administration to get a realistic view of job/internship prospects in your field."
"There are campus police, especially at night and you can always get safewalk, where an officer will walk you anywhere on campus and up to two blocks off campus when it is nighttime. We also have the blue emergency light buttons that will call the police if you press it and need assistance. Partying is the only time you really have to be careful, but if you party smart you won't have any problems. Stay in groups and make sure one of you is mostly sober at all times to watch out for the rest of you, and understand each others limits beforehand so you can stop your friends from making bad decisions during a party or heat of the moment. Don't drink the jungle juice."
"Campus housing is great to get to know other people and campus! I definitely recommend for the first year! It is very cramped though and the food gets very repetitive, so look for other options after your first year."
"I'm not a Greek person, but I have a lot of friends who are, considered, or dropped out. The people who stay absolutely love Greek life, so if it's your style, K-State has some great houses! I know some who considered but they just didn't click with the people or it was too much of a time commitment. Keep that in mind if you do sports or have a large class load! My friend dropped even though she was accepted because of time commitment. Another friend was kicked out because the guys in the house didn't think he had bonded well with them, so give it a go, but don't worry if it's not your thing or you don't match, it's not everything here."
"Sometimes it seems like too much of a focus, but most of the student population loves them, and I attend most football games. Its an amazing sensation being part of the huge student section and I love it! Some of my friends aren't huge sports people and they feel a bit left out because they don't follow or enjoy the games, so if you're not that into sports, just find some other friends to watch netflix with and avoid the crowd. But if you are into sports, party on! It's a blast!"
"I absolutely love Kansas State! I fell in love with the beautiful campus first and now I love just about everything about it! Yes, the classes can be difficult and stressful, but there are so many resources for you to go to and get help, and every teacher I've had has been great about pointing you in the right direction to get some help. The other students are so friendly and even though everyone has their own group, like the artsy students, sport fans, country people, everyone is still a part of the K-State family."
There are various teams each with talented players!
The faculty and staff are accommodating for non-traditional students unlike some other institutions.
I really don't know. I suppose it's similar to other campuses in the midwest.
"I haven't really applied yet for internships or tried to use the alumni network, but I have heard that degrees from this school are well-respected."
"Most of my professors have been great. There are always a couple who are difficult to understand or who don't seem to care about individual students, but the class sizes are always so large for the introductory/freshman year classes that it is hard to feel like a student could get any individual attention. I think this is normal for most large schools. However, all the teachers have open office hours if needed."
"I have had positive interactions with campus security when my car was hit in the parking lot. Some cars were broken into off campus, but noone reported being hurt or assaulted. I have used the campus health center and got great attention there."
"I only lived on campus freshman year. It was a good experience. The rooms were fine. There wasn't a lot of social interaction unless people were really outgoing. The dorms are convenient to classes, but the cost always seems high."
"The pledge week activities were easy to negotiate, although it is always a little stressful. Certain sororities and fraternities are definitely only looking for certain types of people, but that's what it's all about. The Greeks do a lot of community service and have fun activities to attend. Most of the houses recommend that the member live in-house at least one year. It seems that Greeks and non-Greeks get along just fine."
"Game days for football and basketball are always huge. The other varsity sports are not as well recognized, but there is great school spirit and pride."
I have met a lot of great people. My professors have been helpful when I approach them during office hours to get help. There are plenty of things to do both on and off campus.
There were a lot of good things about the housing on campus.
I myself am not involved in Greek life but have visited many of their establishments. They are always welcoming and friendly and have a very accepting attitude. They help the community a lot with their philanthropy work.
"The athletics at KSU are great. They are an important part of campus life and help to create a diverse culture. The programs seem down to earth and are incredible to witness. When attending games, it feels like a giant family reunion and everyone is happy to be in that environment and share in the victories and even share in the losses that take place."
I think that Kansas State University has a very friendly environment and the school is very committed to providing their students with any help that they may be seeking.
Huge alumni assoc./ high level med school entry
"I had an issue with one class, but I made it work."
"Every college campus has risks, but I feel safe."
I suggest a three girl suite w/private bathroom.
Greek life is highly focused on community service.
Teams usually do well and school spirit is high.
"Great courses, clubs, staff- enriching experience"
"There is not a lot of awareness about diversity, yes it is taken inconsideration, but sometimes it is difficult to relate to students especially coming from a diverse background"
"Parties are very easy to attend especially if you are a girl, which provides you with alcohol and sometimes other types of drugs."
There are many career fairs and as well connections that are constantly being made through the school of that certain student. The school can only do so much and I believe that many of it is up to the individual.
"Each class has its difficult times and each student struggles in different subject, If a student needs help professors are usually very helpful and provide you with a lot of insight about the subject and what the student is struggling in.

Many professors are very busy, but still manage to help students individually."
"The safety on our campus ifs very we are provided with many poles ones could use that assist you in case of danger, there as well is usually a police man driving around watching over the campus."
"Living on campus makes it very easy for many students, it allows for easier access to class and as well easier access to food. There are many people in a resident hall together which allows for a great social life, especially when it comes to being a freshman and not knowing many people."
"There are many greek life participants in my school, and i believe they are the students that stick out a little more around campus. Members are usually busy and are always representing their sorority or fraternity in some kind of way, I enjoy most of the things they do for our community."
"The athletics in my school are very popular and loved. Through athletics is how many of the student in my school connect and how we as a whole as well connect when it comes to games or special events, I do believe we have some of the most supportive fans and best facilities for the athletes."
"Kansas State University has allowed me to grow in my education not only by being such a welcoming school, but also by giving me so many different resources that lets me expand as a student and a leader."
There are many job opportunities and internships opportunities that faculty are more than happy to help students with.
Each professor has their own way of teaching but for the most part all have been very effective.
There are many blue safety polls to call the police if there is any emergency needed.
I love the environment I live in and all that surrounds it.
"I personally do not know much, but I have friends who seem to enjoy it."
There is plenty of school spirit and support for all school sports.
I have enjoyed my experience with K-State because I feel like I am truly cared for and feel important and part of the community.
I've liked most of my courses and professors at KSU; everyone has K-State pride and they are willing to help any student who is having trouble with a certain subject.
"I have yet to go into the career center, but I use their website to find jobs in Manhattan, and it is VERY helpful."
"I feel very safe on campus; every couple of yards there are little stations that allow you to call the police if needed, and it is very well lit. I would rather not walk alone on campus at night, and will usually be on the phone with someone in case something happens to me, but that is because of the way I was brought up, not the campus itself. K-State police are very nice and helpful."
"I thought the dorms were super pricey, over +$400 a month for a small room that you share with another person; it would've just been easier to get an apartment where I could get my own bathroom and a living space and other ideas for cheaper. However KSU offered 'roomsync' which was kind of like a dating website where you put your likes and dislikes and what not in order to find a roommate best suited for you; my roommate and I got along great and we're lifelong friends now, I highly recommend roomsync for incoming freshmen."
"No one is treated differently whether or not they are in Greek life; I am in Tau Beta Sigma, which is the band sorority on campus which basically helps the band with various activities during the school year. Most non-Greeks treat Greeks equally and without much judgment, however, if someone is being stuck up or snobby non-Greeks usually respond with ""they must be Greek""."
"Everyone goes to the football games and enjoys every minute of it; I think we're going on our 30th sold out game in a row! Football is definitely the most celebrated sport at KSU (especially with coach Snyder being our coach). We're pretty okay at basketball, definitely not as popular as football however."
"All the students are down to earth, and everyone at KSU loves life and their school. There are many activities, and joining the marching band was by far the best thing that has ever happened to me."
"Career fairs and CES is really helpful, but they could do better getting the message out about what to expect in internships."
"Being in the College of Business, the majority of course work is lecture and computer work. Most colleges promote taking interesting electives (like Music) to take the edge off the more serious and harder courses."
"Besides the rare theft, there really hasn't been any crime or dangerous activities."
"Jardine and the dorms are nice, but good lawd, they are expensive."
"I am not in a frat, but I have a few friends that are. They have a lot of great stories and have made many friends through it. There are many of the classic frat guys in the groups but most are cool."
"Football games are the pinnacle of K-State's sports, but there is always a crowd at the group lacrosse games."
"The actual classes, for me, have all been in a friendly environment and mostly have been passionately taught. Sports and other activities have all been a blast."
"I think that KSU is the best college there is because it is a family environment. i think that the science and math department could improve because most of them are foreign and hard to understand. some classes are small and some are big, and i really like that variation."
I think that the campus could do a better job of enforcing security on campus. i feel like if there was an issue that the police wouldn't get to where i was in time.
i lived in Ford hall and i thought it was great. i think the only issue i had was that the elevators weren't always working. but other than that i think the housing is great and i didn't have any issues.
So far i haven't encountered a greek person that made me hate the system. yea the frats have their moments of being jerks and dong bad things but the greek system as a whole is great and this is coming from a non-Greek person
think that our athletics are amazing and we achieve greatness in all fields.
"I think the school is great, the science and math department could use a little work but other than that it is my home away from home and I love it."
"From the beginning of the process Kansas State made me feel like I was an individual and not just another number. Overall I am extremely happy with my choice. I applied to other schools and I was not an individual. I felt like just a number thrown in with the others, but not at Kansas State."
"I am not in Greek life, so I do not have much affiliation with them."
"Other then the volleyball arena, the sports complexes are the best I have been too. They are up to date and I love seeing a game especially at the new football complex and baseball facilities."
"Overall, I have loved the experience I have had with Kansas State University."
"Frat parties are gross, but they still make it fun."
It's nice seeing people from different backgrounds.
It's seen a lot in the frats from what i know and it's becoming a decreasing problem.
"There is one 18+ bar called Dirty Dawgs that is largely known for swing dancing. It's not unusual for people to party Wednesday-Sunday. Plenty of bars in the Ville, and house parties and frat parties are awesome. Safe Ride is a bus system in place."
"Best parties take place at fraternities, which generally host parties Thursday, Friday and/or Saturday."
"Professors are understanding and curriculum is pretty average on workload, but depends on class and major. Huge study spots are Hale, the coffee shops, and dorm lobbies. I recommend taking an afternoon when it is nice out and study in the quad- BYOB (bring your own blanket!)"
"It's a conservative campus, but Manhattan does have Little Apple Pride and a drag show. I would say things are changing due to the overall change in political climate of the US."
"It's a college campus, so obviously there is drug and alcohol usage."
"I am a female, and I feel extremely safe walking on campus at night. I have never felt like I have been harassed at a frat party. I feel Kansas State takes pride in its health and safety and protects its students and would be very capable of handling and incident."
"The CES is an organization on campus dedicated to finding students jobs either on-campus or out in the work force, related to their major. They also have lots of used interview and business clothes accessible to students and are able to aid you in the interview process, including helping you with your resume. K-State has an online job service and career fairs. Alumni and faculty are more than willing to provide letters of rec— just ask."
My professors have all been extremely helpful and friendly. Lecture classes tend to be very large (and held in Umberger holla)
"Getting into the dorm I wanted was very easy. There are three complexes- Kramer, Derby, and Strong. Kramer has the Kramer Dining Center and 3 dorms— Marlatt, Goodnow, and the newest dorm, Wefald, which will open Fall 2016. Derby has Derby Dining Center and 4 dorms— Ford (all-female), Moore, West, and Haymaker. Strong has the Strong Dining Center and has 3 dorms— Putnam, Van Zile, and Boyd (all female). Moore is the largest hall on campus and was my choice. It has all standard rooms with community baths. Other dorms have varying options. K-State is going to be renovating the older dorms and West Hall is currently under renovation. I definitely recommend living on-campus as a freshman, the social life is outstanding and you meet so many people."
"I am not a Greek, but can tell Greek life is thriving. I've been to some frat parties... As a non-Greek, I like my friends that are Greek, but there are definitely negative stereotypes of the frats and srats. Greek life just wasn't for me. As a freshman, the guys live in-house. The girls generally live in the dorms their freshman year, unless they get lucky and a bed opens, and in-house sophomore year. Homecoming is basically a Greek event."
"K-State takes football seriously. The whole town of Manhattan transforms on Saturdays during football season. Tailgating is a huge fan event and students all walk down to The Bill (Bill Snyder Family Stadium) together. Basketball is a big deal, but football is a bigger deal; more people attend conference basketball games (particularly the KU game) than the non-conference games. Students are eligible to buy several tiers of passes for games— ICAT football & basketball combo, GA football/basketball combo, or GA football only. Sophomores and up and buy ICAT passes (better seats and two shirts included). The Pride of Wildcat Land (the band) is a MUST see."
"I would choose K-State over and over again. I bleed purple, and should I decide to go back upon my graduation for my master's degree, I will be doing it through K-State. Family is a word that is used quite often here, and not lightly. I mean it when I say K-State family and I have the utmost pride in my school. The professors I've had have been extremely helpful and knowledgable, living in the dorms freshman year was a very positive experience, the sports events are great, and the people amazing. The cons include parking, construction and it being a more conservative campus, so as a Democrat, I'm definitely a minority; however, I would choose K-State over and over again. EMAW."
The health and safety on campus is very well promoted and is used all the time by students.
I transferred from a community college and I love the big campus experience.
The value of a degree from this school is very meaningful and will help get many jobs selections.
"Some of the residence halls could have a little work, but I guess thats what happens when a bunch of young adults live in them all year."
Greeks are very outgoing and they have great school spirit.
Fan support is always there. We all love to cheer on our wildcats. The community comes together and its such a good time.
I feel as if I am learning a lot more than I was in high school and thats what excites me most about school is all the learning ahead of me.
"Aggieville is pretty much the place to go. Several events, bars, clubs."
"I think the ""party scene"" is overrated. Not everybody goes out partying like in the movies. You can be like me and spend Friday nights binge-watching tv shows."
"This depends on the major that you are pursuing. There are some who are not in the same difficulty level of others. If you're looking for a place to study, I would suggest 1st floor of Hale. It does tend to be less loud than the 2nd floor."
I think K-State is somewhat accepting of its diverse student and faculty population.
My experience here at K-State has been fine. Friendly atmosphere.
The school spirit here is great. You can definitely feel the family vibe.
"I'm not a part of the Greek life. I do have friends who are in sororities and I know that they are involved in many activities on and off campus. It seems like everyday there is some fundraiser, bake sale, or any other activity held by the sororities and fraternities."
I feel pretty safe when I'm on campus. I work at the dinner shifts at the Derb and I've never felt unsafe when walking to my car at night.
I'm honestly not involved in the drug or alcohol scene. But I do know that the police sometimes patrol aggieville and the dorms.
"Kansas State is okay. There are some opportunities for students majoring in ag, architecture, or engineering."
K-State housing is a great opportunity for freshman
Greek life at K-State is all encompassing.
K-State football; what more can I say?
Kansas State University is my home away from home.
get less foreign math teachers please
I live in Ford and I hate it with a passion
my roommates judge me for not being greek
I haven't really paid too much attention
I love the family atmosphere!
I think that the police do a good job in patrolling campus.
I think it is easy to network and get a job after receiving your degree.
All the professors I've talked to have been helpful.
I never lived in the dorms so this is based off friends.
I am not Greek so I don't have a huge opinion.
The environment around sports is always supported.
I am happy I chose my school.
Appreciate the Campus Housing and all the memories I have there!
Met a lot of my friends through this!
Absolutely love attending the football and basketball games! The crowds get so hype!
"So far, it has been an amazing experience!"
"There aren't a lot of parties at all on campus, and the students are usually pretty chill when they party on or quite close to campus. The ones who party off campus at friends's houses are the ones who come back loud."
"Not a whole lot of options, and mainly to the most social. However, Aggieville is the haven for night life but even that doesn't get really crazy at all except a good football game night and Fake Patty's Day"
"There's a class for almost anything at KSU but if there isn't enough draw for a class it doesn't get scheduled for a semester, however it's relatively easy to find a professor to teach it a semester or two down the road."
"There's a great mixing of students, but it still seems to be a white majority"
"I've never felt threatened personally on campus, however you still hear stories about people who have experienced these things. There is an on campus therapist and you can get 3 free sessions. In addition there is a health center on campus, and lots of support places to visit. There is lots of security poles on campus to call the police, and even a number you can call to have a police officer walk you home."
"The professors on campus along with the TA's are very kind, understanding, and flexible. I can only count on my fingers the amount of ""bad"" professors I've had. Thats why I gave this rating 4/5 because there are still those professors on campus that put a bad taste in your mouth, however 95% of the professors I've had are very knowledgeable in their areas and a pleasure to have in the classroom."
"There are many degrees that require you to have an internship, but don't help you find one from what I've heard from my peers. However with my experience in the college of agriculture, they send out internship opportunities sometimes twice a day. There are many different areas to go into, and the advisors are very knowledgeable about these jobs and internships and can offer advice."
"I do not live in the dorms, but I live in the on campus apartments and they are very lovely and newly renovated. It is very easy to get an apartment and you can still get a meal plan. There is a shuttle that will take you back on forth on campus but it tends to run late sometimes. However there is plenty of parking available."
"Greek life is something that will truly enhance your time on campus. The Greek Community does so much for the Manhattan, KS area its amazing. One of the Sororities philanthropy completely financially supports the local women's crisis center. When students join Greek life here it is because they want to make a difference in the community, not to party. Greeks and non greeks support each other, and we all support each others philanthropy because we all truly care about one another as a whole. In addition all 13 sororities have a house on campus, along with most fraternities."
"Although I am not very involved with the Athletics at my school, from what I've experienced its awesome. The recreational center is very updated, clean, and spacious. In addition there is a new stadium and it is very updated and clean."
"Kansas State is a great school because of its friendly, safe, and blooming campus. The class sizes can be as large or as small as you please, teachers are great and flexible to work with, and no matter what issue you need to be resolved; the staff is prompt at fixing them. Finding a job is easy to do, and employers are very understanding of class scheduling. However there is a lot of construction going happing on campus so that can be a bit of an inconvenience. Overall, it's a great school and I found my place within the Greek Life community and the college of Agriculture."
I dont really know. We did have to take a survey to get into KSU but other than that nothing about that
I stayed in the Honors house a block from marlatt and goodnow but I loved the people and I was still close enough to walk or bike to class
The stadium comes to life when K-state wildcats fill the stands and the football team or what ever team comes into view. My favorite part is hearing the screams and shouts of people who just love to be a part of the FAMILY.
I love the atmosphere and the people are so kind. I would not want to be anywhere else.
"Every student at K-State is required to complete a sexual harassment/violence and drug/alcohol informational class prior to enrollment each fall, and new students in the spring are required to complete it as well. Our school has spent countless hours developing an informative and effective program to let the entire student body know exactly what you is expected, safe, and unacceptable. In addition, what to do if you find yourself in a bad situation of any kind, and they frequently send out surveys to make sure that all of the student body's needs are met and everyone feels safe, and you can see their reactions to those responses within a week of receiving them."
"The degree in Education from K-State is one of the best in the state of Kansas as far as prestige, yet as I have discovered in talking to many of my professors there is a sense that there's a lack of diversity in the teaching styles of teachers. The system encourages conformity to the norms in the field, but of course once the degree has been achieved as well as your teaching certificate the freedom is yours. The advice I've been given is to learn up on as many diverse ways of teaching a subject by taking a variety of classes and reading heavily and just getting through the program, then incorporate all those styles into my own, instead of relying totally on the program's design. But our teachers are greatly desired all over the country and beyond, and our college is an extremely tight knit community which I love! Being so close and thus well connected is what I believe gives us such an upper hand in the job market."
"The majority of professors I have had so far are leading researchers in their fields and the nicest and most caring people I have ever met. Most notably has been Dr. Micheal Wesch in Anthropology, he just cares so much about changing the way students learn and I came out of his class with a totally changed perspective of the world around me and my approach to the classroom that I hope to teach one day. I have also had a very diverse variety of classes as far as size and topic, but what has been universal is my professors' or teachers' amount of attention and care, they are all extremely passionate about the courses they teach."
"The dorms I live in at string community are a little outdated. Specifically Boyd needs a renovation. Putnam is the standard of excellence in Strong, and then Van Zile is pretty good too, but Boyd has consistent issues in the bathrooms of the third and fourth floors."
"I mean just like in most schools a minority of Greek members are pretty snobby and annoying and sadly they overshadow the very active, effective, and friendly people who do great things for our community and campus."
"I was a part of the club soccer team, and I completely agree that we got completely overshadowed by the Varsity teams and we are severely under funded because the students pay for whatever club team they want to participate in or there is no team, but we still had a lot of fun. And the athletics here at KSU are a huge part of the lifestyle of students."
"I got involved in a CAT community my first semester here at K-State and it's helped me come out of my shell and make so many friends that I never would have had the gumption to go and make had I not been in the class. It's one of the greatest programs that K-State offers for freshman, I think."
I feel that KSU has a wide variety of safety services to provide all students with a secure and safe environment.
"As any school I have good professors sand bad. It's really dependent on the class and semester. Overall though, most professors have been very caring and helpful."
Being in the engineering department we have had countless opportunities for our careers and internships.
"Living in the dorms has been a good experience, however I don't think I'd do it again."
I really enjoy the sorority I'm apart of! I always feel very included and have really enjoyed having some many new and wonderful friends!
Everyone has always been very friendly and helpful. Despite the size of the school it feels very small because of the community.
Everybody stays as healthy as possible
I could put more effort into it
KState has great career connections and assistance
They have been very accommodating.
We have a great health clininc & everyone is always telling me about resources. In fact I think it's part of the curriculum that all freshmen take a course on healthy and safe practices
"Advisors are very helpful and want you to succeed, including finnancial advisors. Classes are always interesting and I haven't found a teacher that refuses to help yet, all are very happy to be teaching here. I love that there are so many options"
Not really sure of this yet because I'm only a freshmen
Some of the rooms just feel too small for two people and not a good value
Honestly I see a lot of complaints from independent students about greeks but that's mostly because these students avoid greek life students and don't really get to know them. But then again there's an equal amount of students who aren't in greek life but still have friends in it.
"Like I've said before the fans are awesome. It's great to see the stadium filled with purple and white, and if you don't get there early you won't get a seat. I love our traditions like our chants and the wabash and taking out our keys to distract the other team."
K-state is truly a family and just walking through the beautiful campus you feel at home. My first day I was looking at a map and I had more than one student come up and offer to help me find my classes. More than not I've made friends in my classes and the games are a lot of fun! Our student body is full of energy and very proud of our team. We are loyal to our colors.
Everyone loves the athletics at this school. There are even pep bands for volleyball.
"This school is amazing! The people are friendly, the instructors in my field of study care and it is challenging but not impossible. This school is a family."
"Sexual assault is pretty rampant. Administration turns a blind eye. Rapist pay 10,000 a semester too, so it wouldn't be economically positive for the university to take any action."
The value of the degree is pretty average. How much education you receive is a different story.
I was very lucky and got some great courses. I am dreading taking the pre-requisite courses. I have heard really bad things about them. My professors are great and my classmates are not. If you know which professors are good you may be able to find some good classes for about 2 years.
"It feels as if it is a pretty normal dorm experience. Due to our 95% acceptance rate, they run out of space extremely quickly."
"On the ""leadership and service"" page of K-State's website, there is a phrase near the bottom that reads ""K-State Greeks represent about 20 percent of K-State undergrads, but they hold about 65 percent of the leadership positions on campus"". This advertisement of disproportional representation is a perfect example of the place that the greek community holds at the university."
"The importance of athletics at K-State is best illustrated by the front cover of the orientation handbook. The handbook's cover shows our mascot in the student section at a football game while drunk shirtless students cheer and shout. This is another key part in selling the phrase ""back in college""."
"Kansas State's main function is not education. Its main function is providing the student body the opportunity to say ""back in college"" when they are 45. The university's retention rate is dismal and the students don't have a critical thought in their head. Public intoxication is encouraged and a rape culture is ignored. That being said, it isn't all bad. The staff is friendly and willing to go out of their way to help you. If you want to go to a university and this is your only option K.S.U. is the school for you. otherwise, if you have the opportunity to go to another school that is probably best."
"I love my school. We really do feel like a family. We show our support at sporting events, and help each other out when needed. If I could choose all over again, I would definitely make the same decision."
I haven't heard about anything bad going on in the last month or two and I haven't experienced something personally with rape etc.
I think the career services on campus is a useful tool especially help with resumes!
"I've had one problem with a class, but overall I've had a great experience in my first two semesters here at k-state. I wouldn't change a thing!"
"I enjoy living on campus in the dorms, it helps with meeting people."
I'm not a big fan of Greek Life.
I love going to the football games. They have a really good stadium for games.
This school is amazing and has a ton of opportunities for students to get involved.
Overall I feel safe on campus. It can be scary walking somewhere at night by yourself.
I'm not familiar with student career prospects because I am a freshman.
There is a variety of courses offered and all the professors I've had so far have been good.
Living in the dorms is nice because it is easy to walk anywhere on campus. Having a meal plan is also a perk. The only thing I don't like is it is so strict.
Most of our students are involved with Greek life. I feel you get looked down upon for not being in a house. Every sorority but one has a house for the girls to live in.
I'd say 95% of students are involved with sporting events. Our fans are the best in the nation.
The people at Kansas State are genuinely good people. Athletic events are always the highlight of the weekend. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
At K-State there are 13 sororities and around 23 fraternities so there is something for everyone! The most difficult part of joining us having at least a 3.0 GPA to be considered in most sororities. All the different chapters support each other and their philanthropies and raise a lot of money for their causes throughout the year.
"Any day at Bill Snyder Family Stadium is a day filled with so much purple pride and love for the KSU family. The pre-game videos get everyone pumped up and the band makes sure to keep that energy throughout the game. If you are visiting come to the game and pay attention to the student section, especially during the pre-game."
K-State is my home away from home. The atmosphere is always friendly and it's great to know that someone will help you if you need it. Game days are unlike anything else and bring everyone together.
"Parking is a big concern for me. When students have to walk to their car, or to their dorm late at night (coming home from work, study group, etc), is my big issue. The parking lot is long ways from the dorms, and last year when I had an R pass, it was awful. I would call my mom every time I walking back, and I had my pepper spray with. This year it has been better since I have a D lot pass, but now it's not very good because the parking lot in front of West is closed, so I sometimes have to walk from R lot."
"I have a very good chance of finding a teaching job right of college, but it may not be exactly what I want, just due to job availability. Career center is fantastic. My RA last year brought one of the employees in to do a resume critique, which helped many of us. I haven't really used CES that much, but I feel very welcome to, and I also feel as though they would be very helpful."
"The quality of courses are usually great, but I have had some that aren't the greatest. All of my professors seem to really care, and I have had a few really awesome ones. The variety of courses is pretty good, but some on offered kind of strangely, such as in the spring of every other year. Class sizes are usually fair, but you do have an occasional giant General Ed. class. Some of the classrooms I feel need updated, though."
"The dorms I would highly recommend for your first year on campus. It's a great way to meet people and go to different events. It seems like where I lived last year, our RA made more of an attempt to do different social activities, and also take people (mostly freshmen) to different things. This year, I feel as though our RA doesn't do as much, and we all keep pretty to ourselves. It also depends on what dorm you're living in on how social it's going to be. I, personally, am tired of dorm food. I feel as though there aren't many healthy options, especially in Van Zile dining center, and their hours aren't the greatest. Derby is better, but they have longer lines. Parking is a pain."
"Greek life is pretty big on campus. A good chunk of the student population is Greek. For me though, it is not my cup of tea. I have friends that are Greek, and they like it though. If you want to be a Greek, you've got a very good chance of becoming one. Most all of the houses you can live in. I, personally, view Greek life as paying for your friends, but again, that's just my opinion. I also didn't like the time commitment and obligations to follow certain rules or do certain things, such as study hours, certain activities, etc."
"The school spirit at our school is phenomenal. Purple and white everywhere. Fans always go out to support our K-State Wildcats. It is also relatively easy and inexpensive for students to purchase a pass, which lends to the great atmosphere at the games. Students are literally court side a basketball games, and on the 50 yard line at football games; students have the best seats. Again, we can run with some of the best teams, I mean we beat the number one team in basketball this season, but we also struggle sometimes, like our football team this season. The athletic facilities are gorgeous, and they are even building/improving more."
"My school is seriously the bomb. My freshman year was a little rough, but my sophomore year has been fantastic. The friends I have made are friends for a lifetime, and the people in general are just so friendly. My favorite thing about K-State, I would have to say is the Octagon of Doom. Our men's basketball team can run with the best of them, even though they have had trouble finishing. The atmosphere and the people are what K-State a great place to be."
"It's a D1 school, of course they're outstanding."
"My overall experience at school is amazing. The people, housing & dining services, programs, etc. are all great!"
Professors as well as others on campus are very helpful in trying to get students in front of employers so that they will have every opportunity to get a job in the future.
Although many times it seems as if classes are useless somehow I always find a way to apply the courses I've taken and in general the professors are easy to understand and helpful.
There's always going to be ways to improve but it is definitely one of the best in the country.
I've been in the dorms a while and although it can be great it gets expensive very quickly.
It doesn't make a huge difference in my life but I've heard it's done good things for kstate overall.
When I applied for kstate it was easy as well as personable which made me already feel like a part of the kstate family.
Kstate athletics is a year round occurrence mostly centered around football but the experience you get at any sporting event is always one to remember. You won't find an atmosphere like it anywhere in the country because the electricity is palpable.
"There are lots of emergency phones around campus, and there is a Safe Walk service available to students. Counseling Services does a great job of creating a safe space to talk as well."
I feel like the career fairs and career and employment centers do a wonderful job of providing student employment during school and post-graduation.
I love that my professors and especially my advisors really make an effort to get to know me. It enhances the whole educational experience.
"I chose to live in the dorms for my second year, and I'm very happy about the decision. I love the easiness of eating on campus, and it's just a 10 minute walk to anywhere on campus!"
"Greek life influences what events are held on campus, who knows who, and the fashion trends. Greek life is very prevalent here at KSU."
"I have been to a few football games, and had a great time! The facilities are wonderful and the band adds so much to the festive atmosphere. There's nothing like doing the Wabash with your K-State family!"
I love the family atmosphere here at KSU! There are so many opportunities to get involved and get to know your fellow classmates. I work at a tutoring center and love the chance that it gives me to help other students.
"It was fun at first, but after I lived in the dorms my first year, things got old and stale."
"If you're not in greek life, you cant get into parties but there are other parites to attend to."
"When the football team is doing well, the whole town knows and can feel it."
Its a big school with a small town mentality. It doesn't work for me personally but others would love it
The campus has little to no crime. There are police buttons to press if you feel threatened while walking to your car after class.
My professors and advisors are very helpful and I can always count on meeting with them if I need assistance.
I am constantly receiving emails about new internship opportunities.
I do not live in the resident halls but have visited them. They seem safe and well built.
"I enjoy Kansas State University very much. It is a friendly, learning environment."
"Game days here at K-State are intense. They are incredibly high-energy, and honestly just plain exciting. Participation is great, school spirit is high, and team performance is going well so far."
"K-State is my home. From the very first day I stepped on campus, I felt like I belonged here. Dorm life keeps me social, classes keep me challenged, and work keeps me focused. I love being here. There is honestly nowhere else I would rather be. The only negative aspect is the cost, but in today's society an education is expensive which is unfortunate. However, even though that is rather undesirable, I would much rather pay for Kansas State University than anywhere else. I believe my money is being well-spent on a very strong investment in my future, and I couldn't be happier."
"The school does it's very best to provide a safe environment for the students and faculty. They have a security measure called the blue light, under a few light poles spread out around campus if you are walking on campus at night and you feel unsafe you can push the button and a security person will come find you and personally walk you to your destination. I feel very safe on campus."
"The professors are always willing to help you find an internship in your field. The alumni network is great, so many alumni come back and visit for sporting events and other special events K-State puts on."
"There are a lot of courses offered no matter what your major is. The class size is reasonable, lectures are usually a pretty larger amount of students but the teacher has office hours and you can email them if you have questions. Each class has a different style but still strives to help the students succeed."
It is nice to have a place to meet other people that live in the same building as you. The cost is reasonable for a college student. The housing process is nice because they have a step by step process.
"When ever there is a football, women/men's basketball, volleyball, etc. a large crowd of students and alumni show up to show their support. There is a lot of school spirit every day whether it is a game day or not. They offer a lot of different clubs and organizations. If there isn't one that interests you but you have an idea for one you can make your own club with just a sponsor and group of friends."
The campus and faculty are really friendly and willing to help you succeed in any career you choose. The campus is also reasonably sized. Walking or biking to class is easy to do because the buildings aren't far apart. They also have a shuttle bus running if it's cold outside and you don't want to walk or bike in the cold and also just in case you need a ride somewhere on campus.
"K-State has it's own patrol system and emergency stations all over campus. With the punch of a button on the front of a station, officers can find their way to your location and provide assistance. As well as the law enforcement, there is a Safe Ride system in place that is free to all students and easily accessible."
The professors at K-State have a real passion when it comes to teaching. All of them are very well equipped and eager to help you learn inside and outside of the classroom.
"One of the best opportunities to get help with your career plan and internships is the Career Fair. At this regular event, employers come in and provide everyone with a chance at starting a career or interning. It is a great way to work on your resume and gain experience in the working world."
"Although learning how to share space can be difficult, the bond you create with others in your dorm is unbreakable. Classes are right down the sidewalk and the dining centers have great food options not to mention job opportunities."
"I joined a sorority my freshman year and I love it. There are countless opportunities to get involved and add to your resume. With required volunteer hours and a great Greek Office of Affairs, the college and Greek life work together really well."
"We have one of the highest ranking athletic programs in the country. Attending Division 1 games is an experience like never before. The massive crowds dressed in purple and the thunder of the WABASH is really something to see. Besides the sports, the intramurals and recreational center are state of the art. It is really easy to take pride in my school when I see how much they do to give us the best of the best."
"Kansas State University is an extremely family based college. The campus is beautiful and the students are the friendliest people you could ever meet. I come from a very small town and the thought of university really intimidated me. The moment I stepped on campus I knew I was home. I thought it would be hard to adjust to being on my own in college but from day one I had people I had barely met cheering me on. I would not change a thing about K-State, well maybe the overcrowded parking, but that is all."
"Not bad, sometimes it's fun."
"Not bad, sometimes it's fun."
You can study wherever you feel comfortable.
"There's diversity, but everyone just stick to their own race."
Everyone does drugs or drinks.
There was only one crime that happened on campus since i've been here.
"I haven't heard of any internships happening here, nor seen recruiters on campus."
"The professors don't really care about you, they are just there to teach you and you have to go to tutoring if you want help. Class sizes aren't bad."
"I wouldn't say they are the best dorms, but it is clean at times."
"People mostly join them for the parties, never for the actual philantrophy part."
"No one really talks about the little sports here, only the actual college sports."
"The teaching is great, but when they say everyone is family, is not true. People are still rude to you and aren't friendly."
I mean people let things go really easily when it comes to partying
Overall it's okay. I had high expectations but they have been let down
I think for my major I will be able to go out and get a job easily
I think being on campus during your freshman year is super great because you get to meet people and have options. Also closer to campus
I think it's overhyped. Not like the greatest so I don't understand why everyone wants to join them
"We are pretty great, although I don't really go and watch them"
"If you don't join a frat/sorority, you're basically screwed. People meet people through there. Also join groups. That helps"
"Dorms are nice, great environment!"
Greek life is great on campus! Very recommended.
The Athletics the this school are some of the best! great facilities.
OVerall a great school to attend.
"Nothing crime wise really goes on on campus that I've heard of! There is a alert system that sends of emails or texts to advise students of anything that goes on that could harm our safety. Saying this, I always feel really safe."
"The dorms really try to get you involved. Cafeteria is in the basement so easy access. Hall building includes a basement with TV, pool table, ping pong table, tables, small kitchen, weight room, study room, music room and laundry room. Sometimes the students cause a mess in bathrooms and janitors don't clean until a certain time each day, so can get unclean."
"There are tons of sororities and fraternities! Some nongreeks think the Greek life is good and fun and others think all the members are snobby. All our Greeks do philanthropy and really seem to help others, the school, and the community greatly."
"The school is all about it! The whole atmosphere of ""family"" shows off through student support and team actions. Our student section is always full and the students are always paying attention to the games and showing their spirit!

We are always improving the facilities and finding ways to get people involved in what teams are up to."
The atmosphere and campus are amazing. I knew I wanted to come here since I was in jr high. I am so glad I stuck with my gut and attended KSU. I absolutely love it and wouldn't change anything!
"I generally feel pretty safe, but I really don't like walking to nighttime exams. The campus generally isn't light enough, and I think if night exams are a regular thing the campus should be lit in a way that helps students feel comfortable walking alone at night."
"I have completed one semester with 8 class sections, and I liked all of my professors but one. He was hard to get a hold of and seemed too defensive and combative to have a real discussion with."
"I realize I have a seemingly less desired degree, but there are many internship opportunities. Even if I don't get my ideal internship I can certainly get some kind of internship. I think my job possibilities are good in the future, but ultimately I will be furthering my education beyond my BS in order to make my education more specific to what I want to do."
I don't live on campus but after hanging out with friends that do it seems like a good situation.
Tons of Greek houses and organizations. People are very involved in these and as far as I know most are viewed in a good light.
"Tons of school spirit, students are very involved. Nice rec complex for students."
"Friendly helpful staff, I mostly enjoy my classes, and I enjoy my living situation."
People love graduates from ksu.
We are a huge family of sports
We have had a lot more security measures taken on campus lately which is good. I generally feel safe on campus; it's more the Manhattan area that is a little more worrisome.
K-State is absolutely wonderful. It really feels like the faculty and staff truly care about your success and your future. There are tons of opportunities to get involved and gain experience. And the people are some of the most amazing people I have ever met.
"Faculty and staff are great at helping students get connected to job and internship opportunities as well as networking in general. The programs we have are excellent preparation for a career or for further education, and advisors and professors will help students tailor their programs for both."
"I enjoyed my time in the residence halls; my room and hall was one of the nicer ones. It was clean and had some great resources, activities and opportunities for residents."
"Greek life at K-State has a large role on campus philanthropic events. They try to involve the campus and the community as much as possible. While Greek life is only about 10% of the student population, when you are in Greek Life, it feels like nearly everyone is Greek as well."
"I'm not super involved in athletics at school, but there is a very large portion of the student population that is invested in K-State athletics. Our facilities are top notch and the Football season is a huge part of the K-State family atmosphere."
"I absolutely love K-State. It is an incredibly friendly and warm environment in which everyone is interested or invested in your success. My professors have been generally very good, and I love my job on campus. We have great campus resources and our facilities are fantastic. School pride and the family atmosphere is what really draws people to Kansas State."
The Bill Snyder Family stadium is a great football facility. The atmosphere is exceptional and everyone shows a lot of school spirit. It is the same way in Bramlage Coliseum. Fan support is great at all the home games and even some of the away games.
"On the Kansas State Polytechnic Campus, it is easy to get around to places and to class. The campus is fairly small so everything is close together. It's also easier to concentrate and focus on school in a smaller setting because all the outside distractions are very minimal. I have been in Salina for one semester now, and I thoroughly enjoy being out there, even if it may get a little quiet sometimes."
I feel safe on campus!
I'm a transfer student and so far my first semester here as been better then expected. It was easy to transition and love my major!
The heath and safety is very great. The Lafene Heath Center at Kansas State is extremely helpful.
The value of the degree that I am striving for is very important and extremely valuable.
The courses that i have taken this past semester have been great. The professors are extremely nice and easy to get a hold of. Th class size of all the classes I had taken were all appropriate. There were a multitude of courses offered which was very helpful.
I find it very helpful because it is so close to most of my classes.
I have no comment towards this section as seeing that I am not in Greek life.
This is one of the strongest parts about Kansas State. The athletic side of Kansas State is outstanding!
"so far my time spent at Kansas State has been, in most part, very enjoyable and comfortable. I love how involved you can get within your major or even other activities such as recreational activities. I find these recreational activities very helpful because it is a time where I can take a break from school and relax. The atmosphere at Kansas State is very welcoming and and it gives me a feeling like everyone is one big family."
"Speaking from the perspective of a person who has worked around the athletics program, I understand the love and admiration that people have towards everyone involved. I am a student manager for the football team and the love given to them is definitely reciprocated back towards the student body. They are the driving force that keeps them going during every game."
"Kansas State University is a great school to be at. It's a very friendly school to the incoming freshmen or transfer students, they definitely make it easy so they become comfortable and friendly with the environment. It is very easy to become involved in a club or group that fits your personal liking. Kansas State is honestly a place full of loving people ranging from the President to the students and everyone in between."
The campus is fairly safe.
I have not used any of the resources mentioned above.
The classes are interesting and the professors are great!
It is very easy to get to classes from the dorms. The resident community is awesome!
I'm not interested in this though it is fairly popular among students.
The school spirit is amazing!!
The campus is beautiful. The professors are really helpful and knowledgeable.
They have a lot of safety things on campus and makes it super safe on campus.
I had some pretty great teachers so far. Some of them were not so great.
I don't really know all that much about this topic.
I love being surrounded by people but I hate my roommate
I've heard good things about it.
we have huge fan support for all our events
I love it here and everyone is very nice.
The academics offered at my school are great in every way.
The career fair is very good here. Lots of opportunities.
"I love it at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas."
The absolute worst part is the parking. It's a crap shoot.
"The football team is decent, but the basketball team is garbage."
I loved living in the dorms this semester because I was able to meet so many people just from living in the building!
"I am a part of Kappa Delta and I absolutely love it. They welcomed me with open arms and it is so amazing to have people I can go to for anything and everything. It is truly an amazing thing to go Greek because it is not just about the party scene, but we are highly involved in the community and grades are very important to us."
Everyone supports athletics no matter what it is. We all love going to games and supporting our fellow classmates and seeing them do good in something that they love doing.
I have loved every second at Kansas State. It is a warm environment that feels like a second home and being from out of state I have been welcomed with open arms.
"Before we could even enroll we had to take a coarse on sexual assault, K-state does a great job in making sure we as students are aware of what is going on."
Here at K-state they put a lot of effort into getting your work when you get out of college.
"Overall I love K-state, individually there have been a few problems but nothing major."
"I'm not giving it an great because after so many years of people living in the dorms it can only be so nice, but they are brilliant."
"I'm actually in a sorority, and its a huge part of K-state, you don't have to join to enjoy the Greek life."
K-state has great athletics and everyone is so proud to wear purple.
K-state is a family that is honestly the best way to explain it.
"The workload wasn't too bad, the professors wanted their students to actually get something out of the course"
"I really like the instructors who were willing to work with the students except maybe one, but it really wasn't all me having issues with the same instructor"
There is lots of job openings for my career choice and doing a dual major
They take personal safety and feeling safe serious on this campus and want everyone to feel like family.
The buildings are up to date and are very convenient for someone attending classes and going to school
"The instructors are amazing and really wanting you to learn and the school itself is there like family, they are all so welcoming and friendly."
I really like how this college makes you feel like FAMILY
It's ok for a dorm room but I will live off campus next year
I do not have any experience in this area and do not want to.
KSU has a great football team and I love to go to the home games.
I love being a part of the KSU family!!! Manhattan is a cool town.
The health and safety of K-State is ranked very high. There are plenty emergency services around campus and there is also a health center on campus available to all students.
The professors at this school are very helpful. There are a variety of courses offered and they are all taught by enthusiastic professors. The class sizes can be anywhere from 25 to 400 students. The big lectures are usually never full though. The classes at KSU are very beneficial.
"I haven't had much experience with this part of KSU, but I have heard many good things about it."
"Campus housing is okay at KSU. Living community style definitely takes away a lot of privacy, but it is a great way to meet new people. I definitely recommend campus housing atleast freshman year. It encourages envolvement and makes it easier to sit down and study."
"Greek life at KSU is a pretty big deal. Like most Greek organizations anywhere, it's pretty expensive. I don't feel like you get your money's worth. It is beneficial when creating resumes and applying for scholarships and jobs because there is a lot of philanthropy involved with Greek life. Overall it is a good aspect of KState"
"KSU has some of the best athletes in the country. The fans are always going crazy at all of the games. Even if it's blizzarding outside, you can expect to see a packed student section cheering on the football team. The athletic facilities are also amazing. They are very up to date and provide a great atmosphere."
"Kansas State University is a home away from home. There are so many friendly people everywhere you go. Family is a huge word at K-State. There is always someone willing to help or even just to say hello and brighten your day. It only took one visit for me to realize that KSU was the school for me. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't think twice about picking Kansas State University. Go Cats!"
"Resident life is pretty good. I hear a lot of great things about the other dorms, but I'm in Ford and I don't really enjoy it all that much because no one really talks to each other or hangs out or socializes like other dorms do."
"I joined alpha chi omega and I enjoy it quite a bit. We are really involved with a lot of campus activities that go on, as is everyone else. We're a very diverse and welcoming sorority."
"This is t to say that it's bad, I've heard a lot of great things about the sporting facilities. I just haven't seen much of it for myself. I have only been to a couple football games and basketball games and have been to the rec once, but I e been impressed each time!"
I love Kansas State and its atmosphere. The campus is set up perfectly. They have tons of different programs set up and clubs for you to get into. It's a very user-friendly university and it's definitely home to me. It's not at all as terrifying as what I was making it out to be before moving up there. I absolutely LOVE it.
"K-State is a university that is heavily settled around its football program. With this comes many positive effects.

The football team's motto is ""Family"" and it is easy to see that represented around campus. Even though Kansas State is a large university, it's hard for me to even walk to class without saying 'hi' to at least one person. The campus is very tight-knit and the faculty and students genuinely care about each other. This was reflected previously this semester when it was reported that there was an armed individual on campus. I hadn't even woken up yet and I had received dozens of text messages and emails telling me not to leave my house. These were from both faculty and students."
I feel extremely safe while on campus. The students here are family and willing to help anyone out. There is a fast response time for emergency services and many alert beacons.
There are a lot of recruiters however getting an internship is tough.
Courses are challenging and there are a variety of different types of teachers. However there are easy and hard teachers of well known courses and that annoys me.
I love Greek life and would encourage anyone to participate! Very impressed at how much the Greek community does for our community.
Football is heavily supported but other sports are sort of neglected by students.
I love this school and would choose it again if I went back in time.
I have never felt unsafe
Teachers are always willing to help
I love living in the dorms
One of the best decisions I have made
Sporting events are always so much fun for students
They have great opportunities for students
The dorms really aren't terrible.
Greek life has a very positive affect here.
The Big 12 athletic atmosphere is crazy here.
Lots of security in place
The degree seems to be worthwhile and valued
Have not taken courses yet
Great athletic programs and facilities
I always feel safe on campus and KSU always goes out of their way to provide adequate security
Classes are very interesting and the professors are willing and able to help when they are needed.
KSU is a very prestigious school and a degree from here would be an honor
Housing is convenient and is a great place to live
I am not involved in Greek life
My school is very big on sports and everyone comes together for sporting events
"I love my school, everyone is very friendly and helpful"
Student safety is a top priority in every aspect.
Transformed my biggest fear into a blessing.
There is so much support for students in this area!
Minimize stress on students-cost major stress factor
Participating students love it. That is great!
Throughout every game students stand and cheer!
"My overall experience has been a wonderful one. Campus in general is very friendly and approachable. Feeling like the advisers, professors, AND peers care about you is not up for debate. I have never felt like someone wasn't taking me seriously or wished me anything other than the best. My favorite experiences was being introduced to people who like me want to gain a higher education and make something great out of themselves. I absolutely love my college."
K-State football is where its at. Game days are a huge deal and Bill Snyder (the football coach) is worshiped. The stadium is even named after him. Basketball is great to watch too but not as big of a deal as football.
Kansas State University is such a great atmosphere and Manhattan is a classic college town. Everyone cares about you and your education.
LaFene scares me a little
It's my family and my home
I feel like people will take my degree seriously
I just don't really care
I am absolutely in love
Great friendly atmosphere. The professors want you to succeed and are very helpful and willing to help you learn and grow.
"Kansas State University is a cool school. It has a great college of Engineering which is ranked in the nation, and a top ten school of architecture."
My school has the best pre-veterinary program in the state of Kansas.
"College is great. I have made good friends, am learning responsibility and time management. I'm also learning a lot in my classes."
So far Kansas State University was the right choice for myself and my major. Its a great experience.
Kansas State University's campus is a family!
Kansas State is a good school. Students and faculty are very nice.
"When you are a Wildcat, you are part of the Wildcat Family!"
"A common phrase K-State students say is ""BOOM. CATS. MEOW."" To be honest, the first time I heard someone say that phrase I wasn't a fan. I thought it was kind of strange and didn't really understand what it meant. The other day it hit me and I was like ""BOOM! CATS! MEOW!"" I believe this quote describes my school perfectly. Why? The word boom means how beautiful and great the campus is, cats stands for how many amazing people I have met and become friends with, and meow reminds me of how welcome and loved I felt the first time I stepped foot on campus. I love my school and couldn't image going anywhere else."
I love Kansas State University I just wish it was less expensive and provided more opportunities for scholarships and grants.
My favorite experiences are watching football games and tailgating. I like how there are a lot of free things and resources. The library is awesome. I would choose this school again.
"I love everything about Kansas State. My classes, and professors, the classmates I have, and my campus job. I love how friendly everyone is and I'm so glad to know soooo many people by just being friendly and knowing they'll do the same! People are always willing and happy to help! So many people are always smiling, and people are always welcoming! We're proud, we're K-State Proud, we are a family, and we call ourselves a family. There is great community in the resident halls, and great community in the Greek system, and overall Manhattan. K-state is known as one of the best, and frequently the best college campus, environment, ect. Manhattan is also known as one of the best, if not the best, college towns! It's such an amazing, sweet, beautiful, friendly place; I cannot imagine myself anywhere else and wouldn't trade it for a million bucks."
"The campus is large, and it takes some time to get to class. Theres not a lot of parking for students who live off campus. The ton of manhattan makes the school unique, with aggieville, and fake patties day. I would choose K-State again. Its a nice atmosphere, with all 4 seasons which i like, and really kind people"
"Kansas State University provides a close-knit community in a cozy town. There are many activities all around campus, including barbecues, competitive dorm games, homecoming parades, sports events, and more. The students at K-State are courteous and friendly; I have yet to witness ugliness between two students. The campus is clean and easy to navigate, and classrooms are all located within walking distance of the residence halls."
"What makes the Kansas State experience great is that my degree program is engaging and I have learned a great deal. The professors make the classes much more than lectures, and I have greatly enjoyed even the classes that are not necessarily a part of my major."
I love my college because it is a big town with a small town feel.
Kansas State University is full of opportunity and growth; the students and teachers are amazing.
I love my school. Everyone is very accepting for the most part and it feels like a family.
Its pretty good thus far!
it bad because the college i am studying under keep raising price nonsensically.
I love Kansas State University!
I am still new but i love it so far!
I love coming to school here
"The people are so kind and friendly it's literally like a family here in Manhattan, KS."
"I love Kansas State University and wouldn't have it any other way. I am currently a junior and have had countless experiences that were both fun and enriching through my past few years. There is a warm sense of community and friendliness from people anywhere you go on K-State's campus, even extending out to the Manhattan, KS community. Not to mention, the university's professors are truly interested in the betterment of the students and the quality of their education. Overall, K-State is a well-rounded school that succeeds in all areas of study and interests - such as agriculture, engineering, cancer research, veterinary medicine, and sports like college football."
"K-State gives you the ""family"" atmosphere every day."
"I absolutely love my school. K-state, like many people say has a huge family environment. Growing up in a small town, I completely understand and relate to that, and it's so nice that I can still experience that in a larger college town. The campus is beautiful and I am loving my major so far. My adviser is very helpful in giving me resources to where I can work with hands on things that relate to my major and get experience for future jobs! If I had to do college over again I would no doubt in my mind choose Kansas State University."
Amazing school with a great family atmosphere. The place to be if you're looking into the agriculture industry.
"I am seriously obsessed with K-State. It is the perfect place for me and I truly feel like I belong here. My favorite experiences so far are definitely the football games and all of the activities that they have going on around campus. My school has a ton of pride and tradition and we don't skimp out on loving our purple. We also don't joke around when it comes to academics. We are a family here at K-State. But I would totally do it all over again, the application process was really easy, you get update emails every day, the professors and advisors know what they're talking about. I just love it!"
"The best college experience by far. From an out of state perspective, as well as a first time college student from my family, Kansas State University is the best school for anybody."
There are a lot of ways to be involved at my school. My advisor always sends me emails about how I can involve myself in different events. I would choose it again because it is exactly what I had hoped for. I like all of my classes and I feel like I am learning so much so far.
Instructors at my college were great! They were helpful and the environment at the school was awesome as well as safe. I'm glad I got to meet like-minded people who are interested in similar things that I am.
It has a really great atmosphere. The only real problem is all the construction.
"My college choice was and is the best option for me. My favorite experiences include living in a residence hall on-campus, because I met my future roommates there and made a lot of fun memories. My school is unique, because it is beautiful year-round and everyone is so friendly. Our school spirit is incredible, and everyone feels like they have a home at K-State."
"Manhattan is a really small town, which has a few number of students who are actually from the area - Manhattan. During summer months, I would advice you to take classes and apply for jobs which are readily available on the CES website; particularly international students who are planning on staying over the summer. You would have the opportunity of meeting and interacting with people who are on-campus, most especially when the town is half deserted and not much activities to do there."
I have had the best experience in Kansas State University. I am currently a senior in KSU and I have learned so much these past two years. KSU is a very unique school because there are so many people who loves to help and we can build a great relationship with instructors and with the Kansas State University staff. I do not regret choosing this university I am sure I made the right choice.
"When I first came to K-State, I was skeptical of my decision and even considered transferring and moving. Today, four years later, I couldn't picture myself anywhere else! It has been the biggest blessing, and the BEST four years of my life!"
Its not that diverse so its hard to find friends or have the best college experience.
"The professors have all been very helpful, and not impersonal like I thought they would be. If I ever had a problem I needed help with, I could always find someone to assist me."
As a student athlete my experience is great KSU is a family
"The school is excellent. The student body encompasses the idea of family and everyone treats everyone nicely. The programs are competitive with other colleges, and not to mention K-State has a goal of being one of the top 50 public universities by 2025!"
"well first off i haven't start my year in Kansas State (Fall 2015 ""Junior Year""). Am not currently on any type of scholarship to my knowledge, but i can only do is apply to many places in hope to help me out."
"I think K-State is the best school because of the community. The people are the nicest, friendliest people in the world."
"Being at K-State is a one of a kind experience. The people here are so friendly and helpful. Everyone, including the faculty, seems to want all their students walking across the stage."
I chose Kansas State because it has the best Engineering Department. Classes are challenging but worth it. People are friendly and helpful.
KSU makes every student feel like family.
I love K-State! I feel like I am part of a family!
I love how friendly everyone is. The advisors and staff are great!
"My school is amazing because of the community within it. Everyone is incredibly nice and encouraging towards each other, no matter what."
"I really like K-State, ever since first stepping on to campus I feel like I am apart of something larger than myself. It truly does feel like a family. I do wish that some of my classes were harder, and that the school was a bit smaller, but it's really easy to get involved in smaller communities that help you feel connected and the honors classes offered by K-State are great!"
KSU has a great environment but not very good scholarship opportunities
I believe that I will have a great time learning and getting a great college experience
FRAT HOUSES are a good time freshman year!
Variety and convenience are great
I HATE HOW STRICT THEY ARE WITH PARKING
It is a pretty smooth process
There is a lot of variety and it is all great food
Social atmosphere and convenience rock!
I thought they did a good job.
"it went well, then was delayed but it went through"
"It could include more fresh, not frozen, blue berries."
I really loved living in the LC Jardine community.
I had a great dorm experience!
"Lots of available places, sometimes a little overpriced"
mostly just fast food places and applebees etc.... there is not a wide variety.
Aggieville is where its at. The frats suck.
lots of options but lacking healthy options
The bathrooms are not always clean and the meals at the dining hall are definitely not worth the money I am paying.
"The campus food and dining options on campus are okay. They are expensive, however, it does save time and energy of having to cook especially if your dorm room is unequipped with a kitchen. One thing that is frustrating is how if you skip a meal within a week, it will not roll over to the next week. The best places to eat is not on campus but in Aggieville where there are bars and a better variety of food selections."
"The dorms are conveniently located, within close proximity to classes. They are very safe as you must have an ID to enter the building. The social atmosphere is great as there are RAs who love doing their jobs and plan events for each floor. The social atmosphere is fantastic as there are days when I come home and a group of girls are doing crafts in the lobby, or playing the piano, or even swing dancing. The cost is more on the expensive side as there are apartments that offer cheaper living arrangements, however, the atmosphere in the dorms are the ultimate college experience."
The food on campus is mostly like any cafetria food. Probably not the best quality of food but that is to be excepted. They had a lot of foood options though.
Some peopled really enjoy living on campus but it just was not for me. The dorms at K-State are farly up to date. I had a suit but even the suits did not have living rooms. I loved my roomates but I just need more personal and private space.
"I like living off campus, but I'm also lucky to only live two blocks away."
"Some regulations are enforced strictly and others very lenient, need to be more consistent."
The process was pretty simple.
Many options and always great!
new buildings and many conveniences.
"I live in FarmHouse Fraternity, and it has many benefits. We are less than 1/4 of a mile from campus, I have free parking at my fraternity, and it is cheaper than living in the dorms. It is a benefit to live in a greek house, if a person has the option. It provide a time for someone to get to know a lot of people, just like themselves."
"There are many different types of food, some fast food and some local places. They have a lot of diversity places to eat."
"For people that are into partying, there are a lot of options. A lot of student go to Dirty Dawgs and swing dance or to one of the fraternities that is throwing a party. Also, Aggieville is pretty crazy on the weekends."
"It is a public university, so there are many rules that dictate people's actions. I do not live on campus, so I am unable to speak on what it is like on campus."
"It was a tough experience to begin with, but once I how to go about getting financial aid, it was somewhat easy. The admissions office helped me out a bunch! They were always wanting to help me out!"
I found my future apartment in a week with a great landlady. The company is family run and it couldn't have been easier transitioning even further from life at home with your parents.
There are so many great places to eat with great prices and great deals for students. There is somewhere for everyone to enjoy and the great places are very close to campus or off-campus living.
"The professors and administration are pretty strict, but fair."
"There is always something to do, whether you are a big drinker or you just want to dance. Every night of the week you can find somewhere to have fun."
I ended up taking a loan I did not need and I am not very experienced with loans and money issues so the students at the financial aid office were super helpful in helping me determine what I needed to do.
"The food has something for everyone. I can always find something I like to eat. I love the fresh salad bar. I also enjoy the desserts (Call Hall Ice Cream), baked potato bar, and soup bar. I will miss the food when I do not live on campus next year."
"The dorms are clean and very safe. The food is great and reminds me of my mom's cooking. Any amenities you could possible need are about a 15 minute walk away (the grocery store, the rec, the library, the union, the football stadium, etc.). Everything about the process has been super easy and there are always a lot of people who are willing to help in any way they can. Everyone here is very nice, it has a family atmosphere. This makes the transition much easier and makes the homesick days few and far between."
"Off-campus housing is convenient, but dirty."
Less strict about underage drinking
The people aren't great and dorms suck.
I prefer the off campus living than the on campus living.
There are many great restaurants and many of them deliver.
"The administration is pretty nice because they let you do you, and aren't really up your butt about rules and whatnot."
The parties here are absolutely fun and a great time!
"They charge so much for tuition and room and board, but don't really give much back in financial aid and FAFSA."
"The food is okay. Sometimes it lacks seasoning and when I get a to go box, they don't put enough in there. They're very skimpy on rationing the food."
"It's a good dorm and the RA and others are nice from time. At night the people aren't respectful, also if you're in the lobby watching TV or something, the people hanging out their are really loud."
It's pretty good in general but could easily be improved. just throwing in a few novelty foods here and there would make the dining experience so much better
I absolutely love K-state! I was uncertain at first because it was so far away but I've grown to love it here!
I don't live in off-campus housing so I can't help with this.
There are so many places to choose from! You shouldn't get bored with any place!
They are pretty easy to get along with and they pay attention to what students need.
I didn't get any scholarships from the school. It was not a fun process to go through.
I'm not a huge partier so I can't be of much help here but my sorority friends prefer frat parties.
Dining hall food could be better but they do have to make it for a lot of us! The union has great choices and Call Hall is always a good decision!
Awesome atmosphere to be living in!
Very hard to find reasonable housing for multiple people.
Some of the best dining options are downtown near shops.
I feel as though many people get away with warnings when there should be more consequences.
Talk to the admissions office directly on the best course of action.
The hours of the dining center on the weekends could be extended to allow more flexibility for students.
"Living on campus is great, I really feel part of the community."
I didn't have a problem finding a place and the landlord has been great!
I can't complain about it. Plus it has the varsity food truck which is always a win.
I think they do a good job of it. I haven't run into many problems.
"I have been doing alright with them, though sadly I have had to take out some loans"
I have always had fun at them and there are always tons to go to.
"It's great if you are living in the dorm and have a meal plan. It doesn't always have the best hours and it isn't available Sunday night which is a bummer, but other than that its great. Definitely a step up from highschool food. Its also great if you like eating a lot, because it is unlimited food."
"It's not bad, I would recommend it for anyone's first year, but its just to expensive to maintain for myself. Plus it's too small for what i would like. I also like to have privacy and you can't have it in a dorm."
"the staple foods like Einstein bro. and the great salad bar are good choices when on the go or when you want to eat with friends, but Call hall is the best for lunch and as a treat !!!"
Very helpful with finding scholarships
"They have Chik-fil-a in the union and Panda express which is awesome. They also have caribou coffee, but i wish it were open later."
"The dorms themselves are cleaner and nicer rooms than I've seem at other Junior Colleges, however, if you choose to spend the extra money on living in a suite, and also plan on making friends on your floor... don't. I am a social butterfly, and I don't know the names of ANYONE on my floor. Most people who choose to live in suites are content with only being friends with their suitemates. Also, if you are not in Greek life, living in Ford is the biggest mistake you could make. Haymaker is the best dorm by far. The Derby complex is the best choice people wise, as the Strong complex usually has people more shy and focused on their studies and the Goodnow Marlatt is mostly engineers, science, architecture people.. also mostly studying."
I prefer eating at home
it is safe place and close to the university
Off house campus housing is very close to campus. It is also overpriced and the houses are very run down and some unsafe to live in. The quality of parking and landlords depends on the house and location.
There is a very large variety of food options. The only downside is the restaurants are a little spaced out and are mainly major food chains or common restaurants.
Campus strictness is very reasonable. It does not hinder students' academic or social lives.
"I have been giving a lot of effort the last four semesters and have been doing very well in the classes. They are very tough classes and I feel that I deserve a little financial help due to the effort that I have put into the courses. If I could start over I would recommend making sure you do good in all of your classes your freshman year. If you don't do the best your first few semesters, it can really hurt your GPA."
Technology is fairly up to date and computers are very fast and capable of handling numerous applications along with all engineering applications. The only downside to the technology aspect at Kansas State would be the fluctuating wifi availability. Sometimes it gets overwhelmed with too many students and becomes very slow.
"Depending on where you go, you can usually find some pretty good food options. I have never been upset with eating at the student union. The derby dining complex food quality sometimes fluctuates, but I feel like that is just due to personal food preferences. The derby dining complex usually has a wide variety of foods so you can almost always find something that sounds good."
"Although cost is fairly high, the schooling and most teachers are great. Location is also a plus since campus is so close to residential areas. In my opinion the size of the Kansas State Campus is perfect. The dorms are pretty nice but they're not for everyone."
I like 20 minutes from campus so my area is a little different but around campus everything is nice and student friendly
I have no experience with off-campus housing
Very friendly school and all student take pride in being a wildcat
I was only involved in Greek life for about a week before I decided to drop but that was primarily a personality clash with Greek life and myself. Overall it seems like a great organization that does wonderful social and community things.
The college has gone above and beyond to prevent sexual assault and educate others on it. They also have many places set up for support for victims.
I don't really take part in many parties.
The only thing I'd change is the proximity to the parking lots.
They do a great job of keeping everyone in check.
Everyone on campus is always up-to-date on sports.
Financial aid can be difficult to deal with but it is needed.
I've never had an internship but I would like to do one throughout the time I'm at kstate!
Manhattan is a great college town but not quite a place to raise a family
Fake patties is really fun. It is the biggest event of the year and people come out from many parts of Kansas and other schools.
There are safety buttons but they aren't everywhere
The location might be great but the living situations arent always. I am stuck in the basement of a 50 year old building
I love the environment at every game
Not as many options as one would want at certain dining centers
I live pretty near to all my classes which is nice but I don't talk a lot to people in my dorm because I live in the basement and don't have to.
I feel pretty safe around campus but do know people that have been the victim of sexual assault. LaFene is great but it's kind of out of the way. I sprained my ankle and trying to get from my dorm to LaFene without a car was hell. They have people that drive around in carts to pick up injured but they are often unreliable.
"The only issue I've ever heard about with the police or administration is parking tickets, there isn't enough parking so students often have to find alternative places to park which results in parking tickets."
Being in a more secluded is great because we are surrounded by the country so it's very easy to decide to go camping or hiking one day.
Aggieville is right next to campus and has a great variety of places to eat that aren't too expensive but farther off campus there are nicer restaurants for fancier nights out.
"I love the Greek life at K-State, like all schools each house has stereotypes but the people I've met do not live up to them. Each house is passionate about their philanthropy and are very supportive of other houses' philanthropies as well."
I haven't been able to immerse myself in the program so far the way I'd like to because I'm trying to finish all the general requirements first. So far I enjoy the professors and the curriculum as well as the variety of classes offered in the history program.
"One of my favorite places on earth. They don't call it ""Manhappiness"" for no reason."
It was very easy to receive scholarship money.
I haven't seen any safety or health related issues yet.
"I personally don't live off campus yet, but I've been looking for a place for next year and it has been easy. My brother lives in an apartment currently and enjoys it."
"Aggieville is very close with a variety of unique restaurants, and there are plenty of fast food chains nearby."
I'm not a part of Greek life and they don't bother me.
There are lots of events for Greeks to get involved in.
Kansas State University offers just about any major anyone could want. The big one they lack is for medicine.
"I am not sure on what exactly I am majoring in, so right now I am just taking general classes."
They are many dierse guys and gals.
Overall what I've seen has been accepting to diversity.
"At first I loved it because thy always had fresh fruits and vegetables, and the meals are great but after awhile it gts to be the same things over again."
Basically anything you could want is available.
"There are many systems in place to help people feel safe, yet it is still a big campus so it isn't perfect."
The dorms are very close to classes. Some of the dorms are more social than others.
I have heard there aren't a lot of choices and some can be pricey.
Received some but need more
The administration is more strict on some things than others.
There are people you can call to walk with you through campus at night so that you don't have to alone.
Nice small city to live in. It has many choices of dining out and shopping.
Not much of a partier so I don't know how the party life is.
"There are many unique places to eat at. Aggieville has lots of choices, many that are unique to Manhattan. Costs are usually pretty reasonable."
"The athletic teams at Kansas State are very well supported by fans in that we always have sell out home football games. The basketball games are packed with fans as well. The teams do a good job at doing their best and working as a team. Some years the teams performance is better than others, but overall they do a really good job. The students support the teams well by packing as many students as possible into the student section. The athletic facilities keep getting improved and expanded."
"We have a fantastic Rec building that recently was remodeled. I personally have not had enough time to participate in intramurals, but a lot of my friends have loved their experiences."
"It's very easy to apply for scholarships, but the amount isn't very good unless you get a 30 or higher on your ACT."
"Aggieville is the place to go and has the best places to eat. It has my favorite chain places (Jimmy Johns, Chipotle) while at the same time has super cute coffee shops and unique places to Manhattan to eat at."
"I grew up in private Christian schools, so college seems like a breeze to me. It all depends on what you're used to. Personally, I really think their rules are reasonable and not ridiculously strict."
I'm not much of a frat party-goer. But there are great events on campus and Dirty Dawgs is another really fun place to hang with friends.
"My brother recently just found a house to live in with some of his friends. It was a pretty easy find, and rent is lower than what he had to pay for housing on campus (including meals). It's decently close to campus, but the quality of the house isn't the best."
"I love living on campus in the dorms because it makes it really easy to get involved. You have people on your floor to do stuff with, along with clubs and activities being more accessible since you're already on campus."
I hear that it is hard to get internships.
"There is a lot to do in Manhattan, including a mall and various places to eat."
The RA's in the dorms are more strict than anybody.
I feel very safe there are button all over campus that you can push if you are in trouble.
It is better and cheaper then eating at the dinning halls.
I live on campus and love it but living off campus saves you so much more money.
The football games are really popular at K-State super fun. The other sporting events aren't as popular.
"I hate Greek Life. Really. If you're not Greek, well, Greeks won't give you the time of day usually. There's always the few who don't follow the stereotypes, but I've been at this school for two years and all the sorority girls I've met are snobby and rude, and frat boys are, well, frat boys. Don't trust them. They've got their houses and house parties and if you're not Greek, you're not in. To find your niche without being Greek is extraordinarily difficult, even though Greeks are only 20-30% of students. However, I believe that percentage includes online students and grad students."
"Nothing much happens in Manhattan; it's a very safe place to live. However, there's almost always one or two sexual assaults that make the news in the beginning of the year, as the new freshman are still getting used to campus. We have resources you can use if you feel unsafe. There are emergency pillars, though kind of spaced out, but they are there, and you can hit the button if there's an emergency. We also have Wildcat Walk, and you can call at anytime to have an officer escort you anywhere on campus and up to a block off campus. 24/7."
"Yeah K-State Wildcats! Our basketball team is sometimes good, but mostly it revolves around our football team and it's amazing head coach, Bill Snyder. We named our stadium after him! And a highway. EMAW!"
"It's Manhattan, Kansas. Our biggest attraction is Aggieville, which holds some record for the most bars per block in America or something like that. So lots of drinking. But if you're a rural person, there's fishing and hunting and riding too."
"There is basically anything you could want. We've got your fast food joints - Chipolte, Qdoba, Arby's, McD's, Burger King, Wendy's, IHOP, etc. - plus smaller, local restaurants. As college kids, we can't eat at the finer ones all the time, but Little Apple Brewery is delicious, and if your parent's are in town and you can convince them to take you to Harry's, boy are you in for a treat. There's also local joints in Aggieville - So Long Saloon is always a favorite."
"Seems fine to me. Attendance policies are set by professors, not the school. Very strict about the honor code if you are caught. I have never lived on campus, so I may be unaware of some policies."
"I think everyone has different opinions on Greek life. Some people love it, and some people think it's pointless, but most people respect each other's decisions on whether or not to be a part of a sorority or fraternity."
"There are plenty of things to do off campus, but still close by."
"I really enjoy living in the dorms. Although I may not have the best roommate in the world, my floor is great. I love living on the Architecture floor and being so close to people who have the same schedule and work as I do and I can get to know so well. I have great RAs that spend time getting to know everyone on the floor and I feel that I am having a much better experience living in the dorms than most other people are."
Better than the price gouging dorms!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"A lot of the parties are in fraternities if you are underage, and at some houses, it isn't always the safest. But, there are always people to call if you had to much to drink, don't think you can handle it, etc. free of charge to make sure that everyone gets home safe."
"A very popular field, and there is a lot of support behind it. Resources are always available to take advantage of, but it can be very competitive at times. Overall, a very good program."
Just like most other schools.
Just like most other schools.
Can me like most schools.
The Greek life at my school is excellent. They generally have higher GPA's than non-Greek members and they strive to give back to the community.
"The party scene is evident in Manhattan, KS, especially with Aggieville right next door. There are several house parties and frat parties on any given weekend. I am not much into the party scene but some of my friends who are are extremely satisfied with the environment."
"The process went very smoothly and I received some financial aid. However, it will not be enough to sustain me for all of my college education and I am somewhat worried about where I will get the needed money from in the future."
"The campus is very strict in regards to certain things, such as the honor code, and more lenient in regards to 'less severe' things, such as dorm visitation."
The residence halls are excellent and the atmosphere is super friendly. The social aspect is great and there's always something going on. There are several posters and flyers on any given day that display lots of information about a range of activities going on around campus.
There are a wide variety of restaurants and food establishments to choose from. Several of them have very diverse menus and there's always somewhere to go to satisfy any craving you may have. Their hours are excellent for college students and most of them offer student discounts. Some restaurants even have specials on certain days for specific food items.
"For my specific major, which is Nutritional Sciences, there are not many, if any, internships. However, I am a pre medicine student and there are many opportunities to shadow physicians. There are several programs and clubs at my school that aid in preparation for medical school."
"The atmosphere of Manhattan, KS is very friendly. Everyone, in general, is very courteous to others and there is a definite ambiance in their interactions. There are several area attractions that draw both locals and college students. The shopping is varied. The campus, as well as the town, is very safe and emergency responders are on the scene in a reasonable amount of time."
Didnt get any aid just one crap scholarship
lots of activities to do around town
Amazing sports lots of student involvement
I think its good idk i dont go to parties
Lots of local restaurants that have some of the best food i have ever had
Parking is a problem on campus and around town. Lots of things to do though.
"Rules are enforced, but you can get away with some things."
Lots of different things to do and usually more then one thing is happening each weekend.
"There will always be some crime , for the most part KSU does a good job of keeping crime down."
Certain Fraternities and sororities have a bad reputation and others are fine.
"Lots of options, but student discounts are not given unless asked for or known about."
"I'm not in a Greek organization, but the people in them here seem nice enough..."
I was offered in-state tuition. Exactly what I needed!
"Great restaurants, better people. Everyone is so welcoming to the college students."
Your floor-mates become your family. That's what K-State's all about!
For a small college community I feel there are adequate restaurant options. I have not really taken advantage of the student discounts.
"The party scene is not my priority or favorite thing but generally i found the parties I have attended to be safe, fun, and responsible."
My dorm building is pretty old but it serves its purposes just fine. I like the eating facility and the healthy foods it has to offer.
I feel safe on campus and on many occasions the campus security have escorted me to destinations on campus.
I am in the Human Ecology college with interests in Nutrition and Kinesiology. The professors are incredible and I have the best guidance counselor at the University. I find the curriculum challenging but fair.
I am a member of Delta Delta Delta and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience thus far.
"I applied for many scholarships but did not receive any. After many applications and essays and good grades in high school, for some reason I am sad to report I did not receive any scholarships."
Manhattan is a friendly place. The University I feel is a safe place.
It tends to be more focused on traditional students living in the town. Rent/cost of living is way too high especially when minimum wage is only $7.25 an hour. Absolutely ridiculous! That's part of the reason I'm moving out of this state after I graduate.
"Prices are way too high. Especially for a single mother. They charge ad if we have an option to have roommates, when I do not consider that an option. I do not want strangers living around my children. The rent is the same as certain places in California & I know this because some of my family lives there. That is just crazy to me!"
"It's awesome, but will still leave me with a tremendous amount of debt & also does not provide enough living/housing income for non-traditional students who have children & live off campus."
I'm not in one. I'm a non-traditional student so I don't really know much about this topic.
There is a little bit of everything. Although I would love to see a red lobster built here. We do not have a red lobster.
I personally have not seen any violence on campus.
I haven't had any problems. I would just make sure you apply as soon as you can.
I was in a sorority for two years and it was the worst decision of my life. People in sororities and frats here think they are so much better than everyone else. They are rude to others that aren't in Greek life and are just rude to other houses to make themselves feel better. The girls in my house made girls in the same house feel low or less than them. It also was super expensive and not worth the money.
I didn't hate living on campus but now that I have my own house I absolutely love it.
Every place has crime but I feel safe on campus and around campus.
I get chills going to the football and basketball games because everyone is so excited and hype for the games. Most of the teams are good. Everyone feels like a family at these events.
The atmosphere here in Manhattan is seriously so great! Everyone is friendly and loves KSU. Anyone that ever comes here always falls in love with the town and the people. Happy place to be.
The administration is strict but at the same time you can tell that they really care about the students.
Most of the places around town have student discounts.
didn't have any issues with the process
not the best dorms but not the worst
"plenty of attractions within manhattan, i.e. parks, zoo, movie theater, flint hills discovery center, konza prairie"
"lots of great opportunities within my major; some very difficult and time-consuming classes, though"
"easy to apply, lots of different majors to choose from"
variety of both fast food and restaurants
"Always make sure to check your isis account online to see if you have any outstanding balances and then meet with your financial aid adviser to get it sorted out. Don't leave getting it taken care of to the last minute. Also, be super nice to the people in the FiAid office because they are really cool and very willing to help, so be courteous!!"
"I here sorority girls taking about chapter stuff all the time. One night, I sat in the lobby and talked with a girl from a sorority who explained to me what Rush Week was all about. I have met some cool Greek people and some annoying ones. Like everything else, it is kind of a mix."
I fell in love with Manhattan on my first visit to campus. The area in so pretty and vibrant compared to other parts of Kansas. The best spot in town to go on a clear night is the Top of the World (aka Manhattan hill). The view of the city lights from the is amazing and you can sometimes even see a few stars depending on where you are at.
Policies do not really affect that much.
"The first thing that all first years learn is to wear purple on game day, Whether or not you are actually going to the game or not. There is a HUGE pep rally put on for the freshmen the Sunday before classes start. All of the different athletic teams are introduced and the coaches give a few words. The marching band also shows off their stuff by doing their pre-game performance and the cheerleaders do a routine. For me, the pep rally took me right back to my high school days on the sidelines in my cheerleading uniform."
"Dorms are older, but fairly well maintained. The social atmosphere is excellent. There is always something going on, someone new to meet, or someone to help you when you need it. The laundry facilities are slightly dated, but they get the job done. Your student ID doubles as a campus debit card, so no more toting around rolls of quarters! The application process for on-campus living is pretty simple."
Everything went smoothly for me.
I had a great time!
I wish they had better lighting on certain paths.
Most of the non-Greek students do not associate with the Greek students.
There is not a lot of variety compared to other larger campus towns.
I feel that K-State is average concerning campus strictness.
The party scene is not as prevalent at K-State compared to other schools.
Manhattan has a great relationship with the K-State family
Just be smart and use your common sense. Don't travel alone at night.
It tends to be exclusive but nongreeks are typically welcome at greek parties
K-State athletics are some of the best in the region. The fan experience is like nothing you've ever experienced.
"Without a social security number, you cannot apply for it"
People are always on-call when you have a problem with where you are staying.
some of the greek houses are better than some of the local houses.
"Locals are very friendly towards students, especially new students. Almost everyone you see, smiles and says hi to you, which is very helpful especially when you are having a bad day."
"During game days, everyone is very much hyped-up about attending. Almost everyone goes to support the football team."
"I would say we have one of the biggest school spirit in the country. Wherever you go, there is always an immense number of purple. We want everyone to know which school we attend."
"They're very strict about alcohol, drugs, and breaking the rules. But they know we're in college and things are going to happen so they do their best to educate us as well as enforcing the rules."
There are tons of restaurants and tourist attractions in Manhattan. We have Manhattan Hill which is kind of like the Hollywood sign. We have many experimental buildings that people can visit. Junction City is only like 20 minutes away and they have more restaurants there as well.
"I have never lived off campus but I have many friends that do. They all live in different areas so I have a pretty good idea about the apartments. They are very different from each other but they are all nice and affordable. Some have different perks and are farther from campus, but still great to live in."
"Living on campus is great. Campus is pretty much in the middle of Manhattan, so everything is pretty much walking distance. Everyone is friendly and are quick to assist if someone looks like they need help."
I have not had an internship yet but for my major three are required so I can graduate. They want us to graduate with 900+ hours in our field.
"There are so many different clubs and activities for every major on campus. My major has numerous events and clubs throughout the year. Plus in order to keep us updated, they send out weekly emails and talk about the events in class."
"There are many safety precautions we have. For example, we have Wildcat Walk, where you call the number and someone will walk to wherever you and then walk you home so you get there safely."
The party scene is fabulous! It's always diverse and everyone seems to have a great time.
"Police are all over campus and in Aggieville, especially during certain events. I feel safe when on campus or going out, however for those who walk home at night it is a bit more dangerous, and the lighting for streets near campus could improve. We also get email notifications if something has occurred."
I have the GI bill and my bill gets paid on time every month. The school princesses my paperwork quickly and the VA processes quickly too.
I don't really know much about Greeks here. I plan on pledging but don't see or hear much on campus.
"One of the best places to eat is Umi. They are a Japanese steak house. Its a bit expensive depending on what you get, but the food is good, sushi is made fresh, and the hibachi show is fun and exciting. Its family friendly too."
Aggieville always has something going on for everyone. There are frat parties almost every weekend. There are also always hangouts with friends.
"Athletic games are very popular to attend especially the football and basketball games.

Students are very supportive of the school's teams."
"Talking to the financial aid office can be helpful.

Post financial aid quickly and it is easy to accept/decline."
"Greeks are everywhere, I wouldn't know where to begin"
"It is very expensive to live off of campus. There aren't many places that allow pets and those that do charge redo lupus amounts. If you want cheap living, you need to move to a neighboring town and drive to campus, with the added cost of a parking pass."
Too much emphasis is placed on the athletics and not enough on academia.
They're strict but for the students own good
Mostly fast food places and expensive restaurants for when the parents visit
I am underage but they bars are very close to campus. They have a huge fake patty's and people come from all over to attend. I had a wonderful time being a DD and watching all that was happening.
"There is a diverse student body with all personality traits. However, everyone seems friendly. The first time I was on campus, a couple of girls asked if they could help me find what I was looking for. (Must have been my overwhelmed look.) Also, my mom came on campus and was lost. Some young man saw the confused look on her face and asked if he could help. I like our campus and those who attend K-State."
"The Financial aid office is extremely helpful. My tip, start planning early but never give up. There is a lot of scholarships out there but you have to keep applying."
I have never lived on campus but I have a few friends who do and have spent some time at the dorms. I don't think I would mind living there but I would probably have to use the library to study as the noise level is more than I'm used to.
"I live off campus but I just by a parking pass and can park almost any where on campus, included a covered parking garage. I love that I can get away when I need to but can still be close to campus so that I can attend extra-curricular events. Most of my friends live off campus and really seem to enjoy it."
"Engineering is wonderful at K-State. In one more year, they will be opening a wonderful new facility. The professors and teaching assistants want to see you succeed. You are not just a number. There are a lot of tutors, which are paid for by the college. So, there is no reason for you to fail a class if you put in the effort. They have a good program for those wanting to find a job or internship. I applied with four companies and got four job offers. Because they have provided plenty of meet and great events during their week-long career fairs. They also have people on hand to assist you with resumes and interview techniques."
"I believe we have very caring professors. They want to see students excel while learning. Most are very accessible. Sometimes their courses are difficult but with the free tutors and teaching assistants, there is no reason for failure."
"What can I say? You name it, we have it on our campus."
"I have a lot of friends who play intramural sports and really enjoy it. The athletic facilities for all students are really nice and so is the town's community center. They also offer a lot of team sports so if you don't play for an intramural team, you can join a town team. Everyone wants to attend our football and basketball games. They are so much fun. I started attending basketball games with my parents when I was three weeks old. Good times!"
"There are a lot of local places that offer a ton of ethnic choices, along with your typical chain places. Of course, there is also all the fast food you could want. The prices seem reasonable and there are quite a few places that cater specifically to the college students by staying open late and offering interesting comfort type foods."
"I am not Greek. I don't have any Greek friends either because they have different values than I have. However, they throw a party and are very good about sharing class information with each other."
I have never been afraid walking across campus in the dark alone. I have not heard of anyone being assaulted or anything about theft. I think our campus is pretty safe. I love it.
"I am having trouble with this issue as it seems like they enforce there rules but I have never had the experience with myself or friends breaking them. Therefore, it is hard for me to discuss. I haven't heard anyone complain about them, however."
Manhattan is a wonderful rural community. There are a lot of dining establishments and the school offers many activities and cultural events. There is a small mall which isn't too bad but that is about it for shopping. I believe it is one of the friendlies places to live and go to school.
"The sports facilities are top notch, and are very important."
They are lenient where they need to be and strict where they need to be as well.
"I did dual-degree with Manhattan Christian College and Kansas State University, I didn't start at KState until 3 years in and I was not full time when I first started so I have not received financial aid from K-state itself at all. I am currently struggling with this issue now."
"There is a lot of diversity on campus. I not only see new people everyday, but there are always an array of different backgrounds."
I think that receiving my degree from KState will help me indefinitely in my future career.
"I love being at Kansas State University, I have really enjoyed my time there in everything."
"From what I can tell, Greek life is huge on campus. They have a lot of programs and activities for all greek chapters."
"There seems to be more lighting that has been put up around town, but I normally don't walk alone in the first place."
"I wish there was more healthy options, but there is a great variety of different places and Manhattan is always changing so there are new restaurants popping up."
"The JMC school has great programs and the staff are super supportive, encouraging and helpful."
"Kansas State has a lot of different programs, an array of internship/job opportunities, and has great facilities and curriculum in the JMC school."
"The guys and girls are your basic university grip, a little bit of every type."
"There are a variety of places to go to, except that there are few good dancing bars. The amount of bars to chill out and hang out at are great though!"
"I absolutely love the fact that my University focuses so much on the support, school spirit, team performance, etc. of the athletics and the athletic program. Not only is the university heavily involved in the athletics, the entire city of Manhattan is involved as well as almuni. We are one big family at the Kansas State University!"
"I love my school and I can't wait to get back in Manhattan for my senior year. Something that is often said is that K-State is one big family and it really is. We have a ""family reunion"" football game every fall and the K-State Proud campaign is truly students helping students."
"House parties are relatively common. If you're 21 Aggieville is an awesome place to spend time on weekends. If you're underage and are caught drinking in Aggieville though, you will get in serious trouble."
It was easy for me to get into the theatre program and I also got a scholarship as an incoming freshman. It is important to really want to get involved early on.
They are about to start renovating the student union which I find unnecessary. To make us happy all they need to do is replace the bathroom sinks.
The library is a great place to study. There are lots of quiet areas and computers as well as areas for group studying.
"I am in the theatre department and I really enjoy the program. There are many opportunities to get involved, even for an underclassman. With that said, the department is what you make it."
"The quality of the course and professor varies a lot based on what class you're taking. I have had classes with extremely attentive professors that care about you and the subject matter, but I've also had the complete opposite."
My professors in the theatre department have been really helpful with getting me internships.
"I have not gotten financial aid at the school so I have no tips. I have a $500 scholarship a semester because of my GPA score and grades in high school, but that was just given."
"The facilities at K-State are very good for the most part. The classes aren't bad except for the air conditioning units. The places that I am at most outside of class such as the library, rec, and student union are great."
"I think that Greek Life is beneficial to the social life on campus. The fraternities are not exclusive with their parties as long as you are treating everyone with respect and not causing problems, so non-greeks can come."
I feel like most people in Manhattan feel very safe. I have only heard of a few crimes that deal with breaking and entering into houses. The only other major thing I have heard is 3 cars were lit of fire last year.
"I would say that the one thing that the campus needs to cool down on is parking. You can park in a spot that is for students, but not your lot, run into a building to turn your homework in, and come out to find a $25 ticket. Everything else they do is pretty average, so can't complain."
"The fact that Manhattan has Aggieville is amazing. It is right next to campus and has probably 10-15 bars located on a single block. It is always busy, and a great time from what I have heard and seen driving through it."
"It is very clear living in Manhattan, Ks that without K-State it probably wouldn't even exist. The city is dead during the winter and summer breaks. There is not much shopping, no big cities around for professional sports, and not a lot of museums you could attend. I would say the the atmosphere on campus during the school months is great, but everywhere else it is pretty dull. The nightlife is great in Manhattan due to Aggieville, which is a block full of bars and restaurants. It is extremely busy Wednesday-Sunday."
"I would say that the diversity on our campus is fairly average. The majority of the students are white, but there are still plenty Asians, African Americans, Indians, and Hispanics. All of the other areas that were questioned I believe are fairly average as well, expect for political affiliation. Our campus is extremely conservative and republican. I would say that over 95% of the campus votes for the republican party."
"I really thing that the athletics at K-State is what a lot of people take the most pride in. We never get the best recruits out of high school, yet we still manage to be near the topic of our conference in football and basketball. Our fans our great, we produce a very difficult atmosphere for opposing teams. Whenever there is a game day in basketball or football, most students are representing their purple pride. It truly feels like it is the whole campus against the other team."
"For the most part I like everything about the classes. I can take just about any class that I would want. The class sizes are normally around 40, and the only big ones are the gen. ed. classes that you really don't need to deal with the teacher all that much. The only problems that I have had is the amount of foreign teachers in the match department, and not that they are foreign, but that they barely speak any english. It is very hard to learn from a teacher who doesn't know how to communicate with their students."
Kansas State does a great job of getting you ready for the real world. Many classes regularly have speakers who work in the field related to the class. There are many places you can go to get help with your resume and interviewing skills. WE always have a big career day in the fall and another in the spring. Also there are many speakers that you can see outside of the classroom.
"I would say that for the most part that guys and girls are either in a greek organization, athletes, or from a small town. Each one dresses a bit different. The Greeks normally dress preppy. The athletes are always wearing their warmups or some other sort of K-State athletic clothes. The people from the small town dress very agriculture, by that I mean there is a lot of boots, hunters clothes, and trucker hats."
"The university has been gaining recognition on its academic, research, and student life to become one of the top 50 public universities in the USA. The football stadium had its renovation and has been completed for a few years. An addition was added to the basketball stadium. A tennis court was added next to the recreation building to play NCAA games, legally. As of now, the Union is undergoing review for alterations and/or additions from the students and the public. The library is one of the best places to study, you feel as if you are lifted in the air."
"My program of Agricultural Education is great for those that want to be a teacher and to be proactive on the agriculture industry. I chose this program as I want to learn more about the different areas of the industry. I take classes in agronomy, agricultural economics, animal science, horticulture, and food science. In addition, I had an internship in the poultry industry and was able to compare what activist smear on the media and internet to what really happens on the farm."
"An internship is to allow a student to work the positions that a normal citizen would work and/or, in some cases, a position that requires education. I was transferred to different areas of the poultry industry from sanitation to processing, inventory to shipping, and quality assurance to inspection. The internship, I had, was through a consortium. The purpose is to gain experience and knowledge of the poultry industry."
"There is an abundance of girls on campus compared to guy, which should be no problem for guys to find a girl. There is the rich from the poor, in which is mainly described by the type of apparel worn. The university I attend, also, does have a good ratio of multicultural races, which is great if you have plans to study abroad."
Human body class is great.
Biology is great at K-State but not cutting edge. Professors vary. Anatomy is very good.
Huge! Such an athletic campus
"Some teachers good, some bad. Lots of large lectures."
I didn't qualify for much.
A few international students but traditional students are somewhat alike.
"They're kind, put together, and smart students!"
"It's not a super diverse campus. Mostly republicans, mostly whites. But we do have our fair share of international students."
"The workers at the Financial Aid office can be rude when trying to contact you and there are several times when they haven't given me a full list of financial information they need, making it more of a hassle for me."
Athletics at KSU are super fun for everyone - even the kids who aren't into sports. There's really something for everyone.
I did not have experience with animals like some others did in my major so that benefited them more. I struggled to try and keep up with other's prior knowledge.
Look up your professors before signing up for their class because they might not teach things the way you like.
Cops assume everyone at a party is drinking so you can receive a ticket really easily.
I love the teachers in my major and the work is challenging but worth the challenge.
Library is very popular to get work done as well as local coffee shops and the student union. Professors are great and really care about the students.
Food places range from Chinese to Italian. I normally go out on the weekends and they have student discounts as well as cheap prices.
I have never heard of any sexual assault crimes since I've been there and the police are near if you need them.
I'm not a huge fan of sororities because the girls all think they're better than you if you are not in one. The fraternities are chill and go-with-the-flow kind of guys.
"I absolutely love going to football, basketball, and baseball games. They are a ton of fun to attend and we have really nice facilities. The school spirit is insane. Unlike anything I have ever experienced!"
I consider myself in a lot of financial need because I have an older sister that attends the University of Alabama and my younger sister is about to attend my school. My family cannot afford that and the financial aid is barely any help.
"I have met people from Australia, My main group of friends are all from Kansas but differ in sexual orientation and religious beliefs."
Frat parties are a ton of fun. The guys are very nice and I never have a problem finding a DD from the frat. Aggieville has many bars that have well-priced drinks and a fun social scene.
I liked where I dined my freshmen year. The food was pretty good and the times fit nicely into my schedule.
"With approximately 25,000 students, I can't speak for the university as a whole. The international students are there, but I don't know how much of the student population is comprised of international students. There's over 450 student organizations, last I heard, so you are able to find a club that may interest you."
Student attendance at football games is fantastic!
"There are plenty of places in Manhattan to grab a bite. There are fast food and up-scale restaurants, but mostly the off-campus dining is 'fast-casual' - offering 'real food' at a faster speed than a typical sit-down restaurant, which is perfect for students! Most places also have some kind of student discount."
"I don't know much about the party scene. I do know that a lot of people hit Aggieville on the weekends, but I don't hear a lot of scary stories coming out of Aggieville. It's possible to go there and have fun on the weekends without getting drunk, and I've never really felt in serious danger there the few times I've been on Friday and Saturday nights. In general, Aggieville is another thing that students take ownership and pride in and people spend plenty of time there outside of the weekends!"
"I would prefer having a financial aid advisor, like an academic advisor, who you deal with all the time you're at K-State so you are talking to the same person to discuss questions."
"As far as appearance, Derby Dining Center could use a face-lift. It is always pretty clean, and it is designed well - lots of windows, lots of space, tables of all sizes and shapes to fit different group sizes, and the idea of booths is awesome. However, a coat of paint, some student artwork, and new ceiling tiles would make a big difference in bringing the space up to date."
"I didn't receive that much aid because my parents make a decent living and are still married. I find this frustrating because with my younger brother now starting college, there has been some major financial burdens on my family this fall."
"I had the smallest room on my dorm floor which was a bummer, but I met tons of great people and made lots of new friends."
I only ate campus dining my freshman year and what I can remember is that we always had many options and that the food was decent. I loved the salad bar and Call Hall ice cream.
"Aggieville of course is the perfect place to find a spot to eat, you have a variety of chain restaurants as well as a mix of family-owned places. But it is not your only option. Manhattan is full of little surprises, you just have to be willing to explore and get out of your comfort zone."
I feel that you can always find your niche at KSU. There is an extreme amount of diversity and you can run in many different circles if that is the kind of personality you have.
"There is always a place on campus for anyone to go to and study, hangout, or just relax. Many hang out in the Quad, or in the new Leadership Building which has its own cafe and the building is all made of recycled products."
"Even though I am a Husker fan, I still get caught up in the Wildcat Pride every now and then. Support and spirit at KSU go hand in hand and almost everybody I know enjoys supporting our teams."
"There are multiple scenarios that are possible at KSU. Most gen-ed courses are pretty large but as you get more into your specific skills and classes, those numbers drop rapidly. My experience with professors have been pretty great, I know many who would be there for me if I had a quick question or had an emergency and needed help. TA's are a whole different story though."
"With KSU having it's own vet school, I am pretty set on where I am going to go for furthering my degree, but I also have many friends who have all been able to find internships and jobs in other majors. There are multiple career fairs a year and the Career and Employment Services on campus helped me find the job I hold currently while in school."
"I'm not the biggest party-er in the world, so I'm not sure how beneficial my review will be, but I enjoy going to the country club Dirty Dawgs to swing-dance with my boyfriend every few weeks and to hang out with friends. I know a lot of frats have parties as well, but I tend to avoid them and go to just small gatherings with friends. I think the impact the party scene can have on a student is based on that student's personality; you can enjoy a drink with friends every now and again, or you can go out every night. It just depends on how much free time you have or how much you are willing to dedicate to your school work."
"Like I said above, being in the College of Ag allows me to have a very broad spectrum of new things to try. This was very beneficial to me as I did not grow up with the typical agriculture background and did not have a lot of experience when it came to anything ag related."
"I am in the College of Agriculture studying Animal Science and Industries. For the normal program, getting in is not the issue, staying in is. It is not just a walk-in-the-park major. You also have the ability to take other College of Ag courses from all the different focuses like Food Science, Agricultural Economics, and the only Bakery Science major in the country."
"I think Manhattan is a great town to go to school in. You have the small town feel, but also have the perks of a larger city like the mall and many different restaurants. Campus is close to many of the ""hot spots"" in Manhattan, with everything being in almost walking distance. My only complaint is parking on campus. Sometimes I feel like I am being hunted by vultures in the parking lot between classes sometimes."
they do not get mad at a lot of things but they do not like underage drinking.
you have to drive everywhere
I love to eat at varsity doughnuts and their food truck is amazing.
every store is in manhattan there is literally two sides to manhattan.
I wish i had another crack at college but i still love the school that I attend.
average looking people for the most part at K-State.
Everyone that I know who graduated from K-State have very good careers going for their selves.
Not the biggest selection but it still has a lot of majors to choose from.
a lot of community involvement people love manhattan.
nothing too noticeable we are okay with seeing other para besides k-state on someone as long as it is not a jayhawk.
it is expensive but every one still spends the money to eat.
I am apart of an bglo fraternity and everyone loves our step shows
We support our wildcats until the last second. Everyone gets general passes to our games.
Kansas State offers a variety of student organization/clubs. People of any background are embraced and a part of the wildcat family.
it was long and confusing
I enjoyed it as well as recommend it
We are mostly an agricultural and football school.
I am non-traditional and I have receive support from many different people in many different areas of interest.
Many different clubs and organizations are present.
most students try for off campus after 1 year.
We are in the bible belt.
I lived in the dorms my freshman year but now live off campus. The dorms you definitely felt really safe and everything you wanted and needed is close by. The reason I like living off campus is the freedom to do what I want. I can feel a cheaper place to stay and have get together whenever I want.
I ran out of things to check because I love everything about my school. I love the people and the activities you get to participate in. I can honestly say there is not better college than Kansas State University.
I wouldn't wait on the shuttle because they take forever. They are free and it is nice they run from the bars to campus all night but your best bet is calling a taxi.
The best things about the dorms is that you are close to everything. Not only are you close to everything they are very clean and the food facilities are great!
Although sometimes the connections are terrible in the library they are average. You should expect slower internet when there are 300 students on that wireless router.
Although many believe that the campus police are strict I do not mind it. If they weren't as strict as they are I wouldn't feel as safe on campus. They are doing their as officers and we need to do our jobs as students and stay out of trouble.
It is all for safety and it is not unreasonable.
There are many things that the athletic programs invite non athletes to. I know that the football team will sometimes practice with the military personnel. Students also have a chance to meet the team and cheer them on. I do not attend games because I feel they are very expensive.
"My favorite thing about kstate is the family like community it provides, I feel that this is unique for a state school of its size."
There is always something to do and someway to get involved. It is the best.
There are many international students that study here. I am Hispanic and know there are a ton of groups that I can join with people like me. There are so many clubs for different people that everyone can feel at home even if their homes are miles away.
I love my major but changing majors is fairly easy too. I plan on pursuing a career in the health field. I am excited about the people interaction but nervous because it is extremely competitive.
I love my major but changing majors is fairly easy too. I plan on pursuing a career in the health field. I am excited about the people interaction but nervous because it is extremely competitive.
"There are so many things to do in Manhattan, Kansas. I love doing outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, running, working out. There are also many local places to eat at and do crafts."
People are very respectful and have a modest way of dressing.
The workload can be tough at times but with great resources like the writing center and the library it helps.
It is a tough major. I went into it thinking that it would be easy but I can honestly say I am great at writing a research paper because of it. You get what you put into your work/studies. It is not easy but we are paying to receive and education.
Some dining halls have more variety than others but overall the food is decent and it isn't too costly.
I always feel safe when I am on campus. I can leave any of my belongings unattended and know they will be there when I return. Walking alone at night also does not bother me.
Greek life is great for those looking for a little extra conundrum but it is fairly time consuming.
The winters and be very brutal but the fall I must say is the best.
I don't use it much so I really can't say.
With so many campus police and the Manhattan police I would say it is tough for students to use drugs. I myself am not affiliated with the drug scene and do not know others who are.
The underage nightlife is terrific because you can get into the bars and not drink and just watch all of the hilariously drunk people and enjoy the busy and exciting atmosphere.
"The night life is awesome in Manhattan, Kansas. It is very relaxed and a great way to meet new people. With the military base near by you have a mix of many different people coming together."
Kstate offers a family atmosphere and I think the student body reflects that. Students where a lot of athletic wear and cowboy boots. (Not necessarily together!)
"Living on campus provides a great way to get connected, make friends and learn the value of patience. While the dorm rooms may not be anything special the community they provide is noteworthy."
"Athletics are a big part of college, especially for those who choose not to pursue their high school sport or are not give the opportunity to. Inter murals are a great way to make friends and learn new skills and the rec makes it possible!"
"The local atmosphere is terrific. There are unique restaurants, fun stores and it's near the flint hills so natures beauty is easily accessible."
"Everything is close together an easily accessible. The neighbor hoods are safe because it's not just a college town, families live there. Parking isn't expensive on campus but it isn't free which is kind of a bummer. The cost is generally reasonable and of my friends I have yet to hear of a bad landlord story!"
Greek life is great if that is what you want to do. I chose not to but it is not necessary to the social experience if you work to make friends.
"There are lots of nice people, but there are differences as students of different races do not mix much."
"The cost on campus is not too expensive, except the overpriced gas stations. Kansas is cheap living and there is no need for transportation. I walk everywhere, although some people do bike!"
"The weather varies. It can be warm one day and cold the next, but you get used to it. Just be prepared for windy days and varying weather conditions!"
If I was a senior graduating right now I would choose K-State again. I am thankful that I had the chance to live in the Residence Halls as that is how I was able to make all my friends and got me involved on campus and with organizations.
There are computer labs on campus that are readily available. With that being said teachers do assign a lot of online homework and require you to use a computer. If you were to want to do homework at home a laptop is a must. They are not necessary to bring to lectures though as many teachers prefer you don't.
It is a small town where everyone is friendly but there are still tons of students. It is hard to explain how this big college has such a small town feel.
As long as you are friendly and work on making connections you wont find yourself bored on a Friday night. There are also always events hosted by the K-state Union every Friday night that you can bring friends to and are for free!
The proffessors are good the curriculum could be more difficult but I am not in the honors program. Workload is substantial but not overwhelming. There are tons of tutoring options and help sessions so anyone who puts for effort and works hard can be successful.
Business has lots of opportunities and begin the foundations for them in General Business 110. If you want to be successful all you have to do is get involved. My first year the workload was not overwhelming but still challenged me. Facilities are good but could be improved. I have yet to desire an internship but will begin searching next year. There are lots of campus jobs as I have 2 of them!
I feel safe on campus and often walk alone at night to and from my dormitory to the library (a 10 min walk). I should consider my safety more often but instances rarely occur.
"It's obvious that the Ag Department is draw to K-State. As well as, Vet Med."
I love my majors (Journalism and Spanish). It is slightly frustrating that I can't enroll in some of my JMC classes because there is only one section of the class due to the lack of professors (so I heard).
"To be honest, I don't know much about the alcohol/drug use on campus."
"Coming from a larger city to a smaller city (like Manhattan) I feel like there isn't as much to do. Being a Lawrence native, I lived conveniently, between Topeka and Kansas City. Those places are easily accessible any day of the week. In Manhattan, the closest larger city is Topeka and still...that's almost an hour away. Kinda sucks."
When I first arrived. I heard about a rapist and don't walk alone on campus. That made me feel somewhat unsafe and scared.
"There is more diversity at K-State than I thought. There are quite a bit of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, and Latin-Americans on campus. Along with the country crowd."
K-State is a great place to be! The people is one big reason why I chose to come here. They are always so warm and welcoming!
"I LOVE THE REC! It's a great renovation for students. Of course, football is popular. As well as, basketball and I guess baseball. I don't know, my heart will always be with my Jayhawks. Rock Chalk!"
"It's okay... since I don't live in the dorms, I feel that a lot of this is irrelevant."
"I'm from Lawrence, KS where we have a good variety of cuisines. I don't see that so much in Manhattan, but maybe it's because I don't know my way around as well as I do Lawrence. Rock Chalk!"
"Computers pretty applicable on campus. When it comes to technology, I went in to buy Adobe Creative Suite, hoping I'd get a discount, nope...not a penny. Other than that, it's pretty good."
"When I first applied to K-State, the Financial Aid Department told me I hadn't received any aid (as an incoming freshman). So, I had to call them and practically beg them for a scholarship I deserved. A major reason I chose K-State is because I earned more scholarships. It was just kind of frustrating, but I eventually received my money."
"There are many Greek options on campus, formal and unformal. I feel that it's a good mix. Of course there are those really rude/ignorant sorority girls and cocky fraternity boys, you just learn to ignore and get over them."
"It's Kansas, anything is possible when it comes to the weather. I've lived here my entire life...I'm used to it."
It's OK. I just wish there were more open and free lots on campus for student parking.
The computers at the university have a mix between apple and window. This allows those that normally use one kind of computer to not be stipulated from using a computer type they are not accustomed to. The hardware speed is average as there is a high security usage from the university's IT department.
"The academics at the university have been raising their standards and reaching limits, as the university is receiving more funds from companies and private donations than a dependency on the government."
There is hardly any review about the possession of paraphernalia and the usage of alcohol from the students is safer than a bar.
"I receive the aid I need, but nothing in the form of scholarships. I am an average minded, white, girl, and I am having trouble receiving many scholarships from the school."
There are many options for those looking to spend a lot or a little on off-campus housing.
"There is access to wireless internet almost everywhere on campus, but the network is less than reliable."
"In Aggiville there are many places that are locally labeled a ""must go,"" and they are all really good!"
"On-campus, the drug policy is enforced, but it is harder to do so off-campus."
"If it's cold, getting to and from class is horrible."
"If its game day, everyone in Manhattan seems to stop what their doing to enjoy the game!"
"I just joined the Art program, so I am unsure of what special aspects the program offers."
"I am a non Greek and I often get crap for it from my Greek friends. Greeks are very involved on campus, and seem like a lot of fun, but I am very content not being a member of one."
"Having to check everyone in at the dorms after 9 at night got annoying, but it did make me feel safer."
"I have a lot of friends who went Greek so I often would be at their houses on the weekends. Too young for the bar scene for now, but my older friends really enjoy it!"
"I had a lot of fun living in the on-campus housing. The community is friendly and fun, and the food it not too bad either."
"So far I have only had one, unpaid internship. I really enjoyed it, but in the future it would be nice to get paid because of the amount of time I devoted to the program."
"I am just transferring to the Art department at my university, but my counselor so far has been nothing but helpful and I am very excited to start my classes!"
it's very easy. just talk to your advisor and they will help you out. they are all very nice.
The night life is usually quite boring unless you're drinking. during the day there are lots of outdoor activities that anyone can participate in.
"For a city of 50,000, there is great variety of eateries. Besides the usual fast food restaurants, there are many local restaurants that offer foods from all around the world."
The vast majority of students are white. There is a decent Asian population and an increasing Arab population. There are not any real racial conflicts.
"Though I'm a male, I have never felt afraid to walk alone at night. I'm frequently on campus past 2am and have never been even remotely afraid of any trouble."
This college offers many sports. Nearly everyone knows a sports player and is seen as an equal.
"I hate Kansas weather. One day snow, the next day, sun. It changes all the time and unfortunately it encourages students to miss class, especially when its snowy, rainy, and cold."
"It's great, well for a student. If you want it, you can get it. If not, then you are not pressured to drink or do drugs."
"The have many rules in the dorms and campus, but overall every rule can be broken someway. I've seen underage drinking, alcohol in rooms, and drugs among students. Its a college, not middle school. If caught there are serious consequences, so be careful!"
"Some majors at KSU are amazing, others are okay. Honestly, it depends on who you get for your adviser."
"I am a student paying all on my own without parental help, so it has been somewhat difficult to get the money I need. I am forced to work part-time during full-time semesters."
"I am not apart of the Greek community, but my friends are. They love it and have amazing experiences."
"The Lafene Health Center is pretty good. I liked the doctors, nurses and reception are not the best. Walk ins are welcome."
"Manhattan offers a few things for college students: discount movies, Aggieville bars and shopping, bowling, parks, and more. It is a small city, but college students are always out and about which makes it a great social environment."
"Prepare for cold winters and hot summers. Fall and Spring are wet, but the temperature is always wonderful (40-75 degrees F). Keep a water bottle with you everywhere you go too; the air is dry, and you are going to be thirsty often."
"The engineering lab computers are dual screen and loaded with cad software, programing software, and are connected to an exceptionally fast networking system. Availability fluctuates with the time of day: morning-you can count it, afternoon-you may have to prowl around for a while before finding a computer, evening-still tough to get hands on a computer, late night- as long as it is not midterms week or dead week you should be fine. If the labs are full, then head over to Hale Library and you have approximately a 70% shot at finding a computer to use."
"There are multiple computer labs available as well as a printer/copy center. Internet is okay, but seems standard to the whole surrounding area. The school gives you $10 every semester for printing costs."
"There is city public transportation nearby (a bus) and if you do not own your own bicycle, there are many bicycle rental shops. There is a free shuttle available if you have been drinking/partying and need a ride home."
"I have not encountered any situations personally where any campus policies would be enforced upon me, but I do know they taking parking and driving seriously! Those $150 fines for texting/looking at your phone/using your phone while driving are nasty!"
"While a majority of the student body is white, there is an astoundingly large population of international students as well. It's very easy to meet people from all over the world!

From what I've experienced, everyone is very accepting of each other."
"The Journalism school at K-State is wonderful. While the facilities are fairly rundown and it always seems like some piece of technology isn't working (a broken printer, usually), it is still a very cozy environment."
"Getting into the Journalism school at K-State is actually a very simple program. You'll need to have at least 30 credits completed, 12 need to be at K-State itself, take the intro to mass communications course (it's very simple), pass the CST exam with a 70% or better (It's an exam of English language/grammar understanding), and have at least a 2.5 GPA."
"There are a variety of chain and local eateries. Most do not have student discounts, or if they do, they are not generally advertised. The city, Manhattan, around campus is very bicycle and pedestrian friendly, making it easy to get around."
"I am non-Greek. I have a few friends in frats/sororities, and they are great people!"
There is tons of financial aid. The financial aid office is very helpful in getting federal/state funds and work-study is great here.
"There are a lot of options based on how close you want to be to campus, how many roommates you want, and how much you want to pay."
"We have everything, from a blizzard to a wind storm to a hail storm to a perfect day, in one week."
Printing is sometimes a struggle from 10:00am-2:00pm.
"We have a lot of decent places to eat, especially in Aggieville. We have some high-end places as well as fast food options."
"K-State is strict in the right ways! I definitely feel safe and respected on campus, but still free enough not to worry about constantly being in trouble."
"I live in the Living Communities as dorm overflow, and it is great. I have a lot of freedom and a full kitchen (which is amazing)! We are further away from campus than the rest of campus housing."
"Especially if you are here for agriculture, veterinary medicine, or grain science, K-State is the best!!"
"The RAs are great for helping students who are sick because they have had too much to drink. Plus, we all complete Alcohol Edu before/during our freshman year."
"There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in research, and the faculty of the Psychological Sciences Department rock!"
"Manhattan is certainly a small town, without a lot to do off campus, but we do have Aggieville, sports, and the Manhattan zoo."
My school has an amazing Rec Center that is great for everyone on campus. People love getting involved in intramural athletics and their torments. The football games are a huge event for everyone on campus. EMAW!!
We have very high school spirit and the alumni are very supportive. The sports team usually have winning season and have great facilities
There are many options and most offer students discounts
There is not much drug use at the school and most of the drinking is people of legal age
I do not live in the dorms but all of my friends who do have had a positive experience
I love my college and the faculty and staff are very helpful. The curriculum is very easy to follow and the requirements are well known.
I have not had any issues with the school regarding policy or code of conduct
I have had no problems getting financial aid until this semester
If it is too cold or too hot I try to get a ride to campus instead of walking to campus
There is a wide selection of off campus housing and most is affordable with room mates
"If you work hard to find your academic niche, K-State will work well for you."
Centers are easily accessible and helpful.
Pretty standard for a state university.
"The process is long, but understandable, and you often receive aid."
Mostly centers around Greek Life and binge drinking.
Pretty standard for a state university.
K-State basketball and football are huge parts of the social community.
Pretty standard for a state university.
"It can be very easy to find quality options, as long as you start the process early. Housing fills up quickly."
"The diversity of the Kansas climate can make it difficult to dress appropriately, depending on the time of year."
I have not noticed any drugs on campus since i have been here
THe winters are really harsh but the rest of the year it is pretty great.
I haven't needed the police but i have noticed their presence
I have some friends in frats and sororities and they are pretty cool but occasionally I do hear about frats being rude towards non frats and such
It is pretty easy to get away with a lot of things in the dorms but if you get caught you do get a punishment fitting for the crime
I love being on campus. My roommate didn't turn out that great but I got to know so good people and am going to be moving in with them next year. The classes are close to the dorms on campus so it isn't too far to walk anywhere.
It takes a lot of time but just look for it.
Diverse but not to diverse
Fake Patties day is a great time.
The dorm life is a good time. You meet a lot of new people.
Lots of great places to eat on and off campus.
It takes allot of forms but you get what you need.
Kansas State is very strict on everything.
"Parting happens allot at K-State, but i don't see any drug use."
Love the atmosphere here around sporting events.
Never had any problems on or off campus
The parking is probable the number one problem.
"There need to be police walking around or monitoring later in the evening after some students have taken tests. They are very efficient in pulling people over, but there needs to be more on and off campus patrolling"
"Financial aid is always a long process, and stressful."
Not sure. Have my own means of transportation.
"Academics the campus is fairly strict, but when it comes to social life the campus tries to stay out of it."
"School spirit, fan support, and everything else sports related is pretty phenomenal."
"Greeks seem to dominant the school. I have noticed anyone being treated differently for not being apart of Greek life, but I have noticed people in Greek life secretly make fun of the non-Greek"
"I've never noticed the use of any drugs, but it is very noticeable to see all the alcohol consumption. Dorms have a no alcohol policy, but it is never really enforced."
I have just decided what major I am going to be in so I haven't gotten much of a chance to experience the program. I am pre-dental and couldn't figure out a major that would be interesting as well as match up with the majority of classes that for the prerequisites for pre-dental. I have to decided to major in biology then continue on to dental school.
"There haven't been really any difficulties with my program, the only issue was finally deciding on which one I should chose."
"There isn't much availability on housing or apartments, also most are a bit of a hike to get to campus."
Kansas weather usually ruins the experience of walking to class. One second its hot and the next it's freezing.
"Not much of a nightlifer, but the transportation for what I hear could be improved."
"Dorms are small, but I did enjoy having a bathroom that I only shared with my roommates. The cost of living is a bit extreme, but the location to the classrooms as well as dining is ideal."
"There isn't a lot of variety to nightlife and weekend activities. There isn't too much to do around here. There are some fun attractions such as the zoo and some of the parks. Shopping could be improved, but it is better than nothing. I usually feel pretty safe around here, I still would never walk around at night alone. Security could be increased around here especially at evenings after tests."
The computers are usually work well. There are a few issues of the mouse not working on some of the computer. Also when it is time for a final there seem to be no computer available.
I had my first internship last summer. It didn't pay well but they provided housing. Getting the experience was totally worth it! I learned a lot and made connections with people from all over the country. I have another internship this summer that provides housing and pays that I'm looking forward to!
"I am in the theatre program here at K-State. It is easy to get involved and some of the professors/instructors are fantastic. I've reached the point where they are my friends more than my teachers. You get to work with them on projects and there is always something going on. Rehearsals for shows are in the evenings which can cut into employment opportunities, a social life, and time for homework."
The whole town is purple all year long. School spirit is found all over town.
There is a nice variety of restaurants/bars in Aggieville. We have a group that eats somewhere different every Friday.
"They're trying to improve the shuttle bus system on campus. Not many people use it unless they live in Jardine, the on-campus apartments. It's easier just to walk places and if it's to far away, just drive or find a friend with a car."
"If you want to drink you can, but if not that's okay too. Drinking and driving is never okay, but it's easy to walk to Aggieville and most parties."
"I used the student health center for the first time last week and it was okay. The nurses and doctor I interacted with were nice, but the pharmacy caused me huge problems."
I have the feeling like I am home. I can ride my bike around town and even have a stop light that responds when I wait at the stop light. If I decide to party it is one block from the university and their is a bus provide at night for a safe return home.
"The university has a great amount of academics to choose from along with the option to attend class with a student, which allows the visitor to feel as if they already attend there. In addition, the university is gaining popularity as one of the top 50 public universities in the USA."
"There are a few restaurants of different nationalities, but the city is still undergoing expansion."
"The university has allowed itself to be diversified from all different nationalities. Every year, it seems that a new group of people enter the university for higher education. Plus it is great to experience another culture."
The university has allowed many clubs to be formed as well as provide funding options for events to provide fun or an educational experience. The security it present around campus and not like a bug trying to enter your ear.
"Lived in dorms for a year, great way to meet people"
great in the morning when I want to get to campus.
"No major issues, people seem to be accepting."
The Kansas weather overall has been a hassle.
No major difficulties. Everything went smooth.
Has the resources I need for the career I want.
Has the major I want and I enjoy all classes.
I feel safe walking around campus when alone.
"Nothing to complain about, very efficient."
Standard strictness. It is understandable.
Small town with a great personality.
Although you dont have the chance to really connect with other people other than you roommates you still have the opportunity to feel like your right at home
Kansas state univerisity is mainly a school for agriculture and along with my major (animal science and industry) its a great fit
I have not had an internship but I heard that the faculty at KSU are great at helping you find them
You have great internet if you live in the k-state owned apartments (Jardine apartments) but the dorms are ok.
Kansas weather is very stressful. One day it could be snowing the next it could be 65 degrees outside.
You have to either have a job to afford bus tickets or plane tickets or have enough friends from where you are form in order to get a ride home as long as you chip in gas money.
"We have plenty of choices for intramural sports. Even for the less noticed sports like Foosball, table tennis, boxing"
There are plenty of foreigners to become friends with. There are alot of clubs to join to learn about different cultures.
They have alot of places to go to find you rfaivorite food. whether it be tacos. burger or icecream
As long as you do what your supposed to do and be respectful to the law of this school then you wont get into trouble.
I am very happy. I just want to get done. I think I can find a job
It was easy. Just apply to the university and college.
"some RAs are mean about alot of things, but thats their personality so just avoid the mean RAs"
you have to be willing to try the local restaurants!!
its the middle on kansas so of course we have alot of conservative christians... its to be expected
the classes are challenging but the teachers are always willing to help
Greek life here on campus is great. It gives an opportunity for people to get involved in things they like.
Off campus food options are kind of redundant and don't offer much quality.
The wifi on campus is great. The computers connected to the network are very fast and reliable.
The academics here at K-State Salina are pretty good.
Our financial aid adviser is not willing to help look up personal scholarships for students. (K-State Salina)
K-State Salina is not the main campus and you can definitely tell. I would rather live there any day.
"K-State Salina does not have one of these, but the one on Manhattan is not bad!"
"Campus housing is usually pretty good, but it is definitely too expensive."
"K-State Salina is very diverse. Since it is the school of aviation and technology , people from all over the world come to learn to fly."
The off campus housing selections are hard to judge.
"Athletics are a huge part of the K-State atmosphere, EMAW!"
"Coming from New York, I am a student who is used to and loves diversity. Although I love my school here, it is not a great cultural mix. A high percentage of the student body is white, middle-class, and Christian."
"Here at Kansas State University, we only have one shuttle system that can be used campus wide. It runs on a route that does not cover all of campus, but runs on a reliable schedule. Because of this reason, most students ride bikes or drive cars."
Could use some more diverse things.
I wish I had more help from my advisor.
Snow and heat rarely affect me.
It doesn't affect very many.
Could have more variety for different ethnic groups and taste in music
Uh just like a small town.
This school keeps students safe while still letting us grow into our adult lives and learn to be responsible.
Could use a campus bus system.
A lot of underage and drinking and drug use.
"I need more money, it is so stressful. I want to continue attending Kansas State but I do not want to bury myself in debt."
"I think our campus strictness is at a great level of lenient enough so we can have fun, but strict enough to where we aren't going to go too crazy."
It's Kansas. You can expect every season in 1 single day.
"A lot of bad things have been happening lately, but the goods definitely outweigh the bad"
The off campus housing is pretty expensive
"Some local places are amazing, plus AGGIEVILLE"
Loads of people are involved in greek life but they aren't the usual jerks of greeks
Its great to have the diversity we have on campus. Its just the right amount of diversity.
The tech support is helpful and the entire campus is wireless
Very close to classes and great people!
I haven't used it much but a lot of students find it helpful.
Aggieville is about it. Besides that a boring city
I moved into a greek house after living one semester in the dorms. My house is really old but has a lot of character. Greek life housing has given me a lot of opportunities for leadership. Greek life kind of dominates social parties on the weekends; if not greek you will find yourself looking for fun. Greek life is given fun to you.
"I currently live in a fraternity house behind Aggieville, and the location is perfect. It is cheaper than dorm options, and offer more opportunities to grow yourself. Off campus living was the best option I could have done this year."
"The best parties here our Greek Life, kind of biased, but there are great GDI parties if you choose to go that route. Lot of beer is here, but I'm not country. On that note, Dirty Dawgs is a good option for dancing and a nonalcoholic option."
I am trying to concentrate on my school work so I try to avoid the party's .
I participate in a lot of intramural sports . Our rec center is fantastic!
"I have my own laptop, so I don't use the schools very often."
The students are given all sorts of informations on how to contact their school and professors. Their professors usually explain ways on getting tutored on subjects that they need extra help in. Other information they want to look for they can just look on the K-State homepage.
"My favorite spots to eat off campus is the local asian restaurants and chipotle. However, I mostly eat at home with my family."
"During the winter we have a lot of snow especially right now, due to a snow storm the campus has been closed for two days. However, overall the weather hasn't affected the campus to much."
"Kansas State Universities Library has at least four levels and each level has a number of computers that students either use to finish assignments/projects/online quizzes. Others use it for personal uses or research, for me I use the computers to print my papers. Printing is only $0.10 per paper, students can use their student ID cards to pay. As for the wireless connection on campus for your laptop, all the class rooms have it though some of them are weak connections."
"Kansas State University is known to have many students with different personal, economic and social backgrounds. Many students on this campus are accepting of these diversities, we all get along with each other even if we are different in a way. I like how open students are with their sexual orientation and beliefs, because they are not judged by others. All the students treat each other the way they would like to be treated back."
Aggieville has so many places I go all in one area
I love manhattan. Kansas is definitely better than everyone thinks it to be
Teachers want to help and there are lots of opportunities to get help and tutoring
Kansas weather is bipolar. It can go from 50 degrees and sunny to 30 and snowing in one day
I love swing dancing at dirty dawgs!
From what I had seen houses and apartments off campus are pretty nice!
It's college they want you to learn from mistakes so they don't make you do too much other than what is best for the safety of everyone else
Have not had an internship but accessibility to finding jobs and companies that are hiring is great.
Have not had an internship but accessibility to finding jobs and companies that are hiring is great.
Campus is small so getting around is easy on foot and by bike. The shuttle is also available for getting to the dining halls from apartments and can make it easier and quicker to get from one side of campus to the other.
Computers are available but having your own is easier. Wireless is pretty good a little slow in the dorms but by bad for how many people are using it.
A fair amount of diversity
Not the greatest but still pretty good
there are plenty of scholarships but you have to be pretty unique to apply
it's Kansas so you can expect freezing winters and blazing hot summers.
lots of variety and options
Many students participate in drinking. I'm not sure of the drug scene. Manhattan and KSU provide DD drivers that you can call at anytime to take you home.
I use my own vehicle so I don't know a lot on this topic. :(
I live in a wonderful and friendly residence hall (Haymaker). We really all become family and I love how everyone is so open and willing to help.
They have very new and updated computers and technology.
I live on-campus so I don't know much about it. I do know that you would probably have to be a full time worker to be able to afford to live off-campus.
I know it is very expensive and that you pay monthly to basically just have a title. You also have to have a pretty high GPA to stay in the sorority or fraternity.
"In Manhattan there is a good variety of local hangouts, bars, restaurants and clubs."
park is cheap compared to other schools
Program is very geared towards young professional and growth.
"Small with limited options... while there is enough to keep you interested,,, but all small restaurants and when they are busy they are impossible to get into."
Other ways to get involved without going greek.
One of the best Engineering Departments around.
Easily accessible. Right next to campus.
Not too strict other than on Parking and Honor code.
Many bus stops along campus. Everything else is within walking distance.
"Not personally too interested in relationships, but it seems like it's good."
Very valued at this school
"Many different people, only not in my field of study"
"Many good scholarships available, but a lot of hastle to obtain and apply"
It's not the best Wi-Fi.
Only the Caucasian greeks have housing and the African American greeks do not.
Variety of options but not late at night.
"My major is Graphic DESIGN and should be in the DESIGN Department along with interior DESIGN and product DESIGN, but sadly it is in the Art Department. The program is fairly difficult to get into. You must take two years of general art classes and then you can apply to get into your program and you might not make it. In that case you can either reapply once more or find a new major. For Graphic Design this means that you getting into your major is based entirely on general art classes and not on any GRAPHIC art."
"My FASFA had issues and was sent to the botto of the stack, I received the least amount of aid possible... The are very few scholarships."
"There is none unless you drive a car, but most things are within walking distance."
"Not very strict on most things, but if you make the wrong person mad they can overreact. We have a rule that if you are in the presence of a violation that you are also responsible and it is sometimes unfair."
Okay but boring. Typical small town.
The building and furnishings are very old. The community bathrooms have many issues including clogged drains and only one hand dryer.
"There is seasonal ice skating, bowling, Swing Dancing clubs, but other than that the town is pretty boring."
Its for safety. They give out a lot of parking tickets!
Its good hard to find housing close to campus
There are tons of different people.
There are plenty of places to eat and hang out with friends!
"It's not mom's cooking, but it sure is good!"
There is a wide variety of people on campus.
Greek life is seen all over the campus. There are some professional fraternities endorsed by the colleges.
"Kansas weather is great, you won't get bored of the same weather everyday."
"Many of my friends drive and they rarely complain. Only about spots, but it's fine."
"It is literally the best thing that has happened to me, and I wish to continue to attend!"
"You barely see anyone taking part in drug activities. You rarely see smokers on campus, but you may hear about parties that have alcohol available."
The tech team at this campus does work very hard to keep the network up and running. They are also available most of the time for help. There are loads of computer labs as well as campus wide wi-fi. Most if not all students have personal computers that they use.
Aggieville is supposed to be the best place and makes this college town come alive. I have personally never gone because I'm not 21.
"I love my major, Computer and Information Sciences, because it's taught so well and there is plenty of available help!"
There are not many options for me right now. Professors do email students that are interested in scholarship opportunities and such.
Aggieville is a sort of downtown area filled with bars and stores that K-State is well-known for.
"My sister lives in a house with three other girls off-campus, and it is a cute place. With roommates, housing can be affordable."
"K-State really is a great school. I'm in the marching band, and the experience has been absolutely unreal."
"Manhattan could be described as a large town; there are few confusing roadways and urbanized sections, and people are generally friendly."
not old enough for a bar but night life. There are parties and transportation when needed.
I love my school and again the most favorite thing is even if it is a somewhat big school it has that small town feel. that's what I like most about it.
mostly walk to everything on campus unless at night or bad weather. Most everything is pretty close to walk to so far for classes I have taken.
my mom and I worked hard together to get financial aid. It was time consuming and had trouble getting the information thru fasfa to school. I did get several scholarships in high school and from K-state.
no issues that I have seen where people don't associate you if you are greek.
most everyone is accepting as I have not seen any discrimination with my own eyes
jobs on campus are great because they are willing to work with you when you have exams. Our campus is big but it has a small town feel which I love. I love the sport venues and enjoy going to these events. We have great school spirit.
love hanging out on campus and my dorm. love being involved in sorority a and all hangouts are great. Again small town feel every where.
for the most part we have always have wifi and speed is fine. On occasion there are some issues but usually fixable
Love the atmosphere and campus overall.
for the most part we are treated as adults
I would like more variety and healthier options.
"I don't see a huge party scene but know there are parties. Being in a sorority you have to be pretty responsible so I try not to take part in this activity but have in the past, only drinking on occasion"
my dorm is fairly close to all of the buildings I go to. It can be yucky to have to walk in the bad weather.
Plenty of places to study and go to the library quite often.
My work load can be stressful but it is challenging. I would like to look for a job if I could manage. I sometimes have trouble focusing so it's harder for me to study.
I feel safe most of the time on campus and will not walk alone but in groups. If I have to go to a night class I may drive and have gotten several tickets because I did not want to walk alone. They really should allow kids to drive to a night class in this day and age without giving tickets.
i have a variety of friends whether its there personalities ethnic backgrounds or sexual orientation.
Most of my profesors are really nice and care for the students.
The curriculum is set up nicely and easy to follow and know what you are suppose to be taking.
i love the college of business there are a lot of great opportunities and the faculty and staff are very helpful and friendly.
im not in greek life but have friends who are but im only friends with them because they are unique and not follow the flow of there greek members. i do see alot of guys/girls who do things just because everyone else is doing it so that they fit in.
The worst thing are the prices. There are not a whole lot of landlords to choose from so they know they can raise prices on apartments etc. Also its a college town so that also makes it easy for them to raise prices because they know we students will pay to live off campus because we love our freedom.
i have a car of my own so i dont really now how the transportation is really like.
A lot of places are closed during school breaks so we dont have many options to eat a different variety of foods. They are never open late.
Its cold some times but then again its Kansas the weather is so unpredictable.
In the beginning i would have done things differently
"The process with the university is easy. However, if you have outside scholarships, they can try and manipulate your decision or not go straight to the answer. Not bad, but it seems they have always been on auto-pilot than listening to the customer's request."
"When I compare the universities I attend, whether for school or conferences, I have this feeling of welcome as if it is home."
"There has not been many issues against crime on campus. There has been a few events this past year at my university, but nothing for a global pandemic."
"The university provides transportation to reduce drunk driving and provide safe travels to your destinations. There are plenty of options to choose if you want fun or comfort. Other students do plan party nights, but are cautious about the legal drinking age."
"Jardine is school affiliated, but upperclassmen or married students live there mostly. There are apartment complexes close, prices range from $600-$900 a month for 1 bedroom."
"Permits are expensive, on campus or off. The parking lots are large, but none of them are close to central campus. Tickets are expensive so don't park where you shouldn't. You really don't need a car if you live on campus, but the apartments close to campus expensive."
"The local buses run for free on campus, as well as safe ride for the weekends to prevent intoxicated driving."
"Im really only in the one department I major in, but we all dress nicely, are active socially but tend not to date each other."
"I am a music major, so the admission process was different for me. There are auditions involved for every studio, and each one requires different things so check and make sure to get your name in early."
The entire music department is like a family; everyone knows everyone and everybody is always willing to lend a helping hand if you need it.
"Student academics on KSU is checked on by their advisors, and more than likely other teachers to make sure they are on track."
Start early and be persistent! Its difficult to keep everything organized
Its very rare to hear about any drug use because its virtually nonexistent on campus
I loved the food at the dining centers when I lived on campus. There was always a great variety of healthy options. The hours could be better on weekends.
Most people are conservative and a large population of our campus is white. We do have an LGBT resource center.
"We're in Kansas, so weather varies a lot every day. Be prepared to walk to class in all temperatures. Campus will close occasionally due to snow. There are designated tornado areas around campus for shelter in case of a storm."
"Keep your GPA up and apply for scholarships every year and you'll probably get something, but it may not be much. It's important to apply for scholarships from the university and your academic department - they're different applications. Chances are it won't pay for everything, but it'll help."
"Football games are really fun to attend, especially in the student section. I've attended football, men's basketball, women's basketball, volleyball, baseball, and equestrian. You get in free to most sporting events with your student id (just not football and men's basketball, but those tickets are discounted for students)."
Wi-fi is spotty all over campus. In some buildings it's really fast and in others I don't have any service. It's a constant battle. Everyone owns their own laptop.
This is my first year living off campus and I'm only a couple blocks away from campus. It's nice because I don't have to drive to class. I prefer living on campus.
"If you live far from campus, have fun getting up extra early to attempt to find a parking spot. They fill up extremely quickly and lots are not especially close to buildings. If you park without a permit or in the wrong area, you WILL get a ticket."
"Academics are fantastic considering the cost of tuition. Graduates of the College of Engineering are essentially guaranteed jobs, Veterinary School and College of Architecture are nationally ranked. Campus activities are adequate, but overall culture of the town is minimal."
"The campus is beautiful, Kansas limestone covers all the buildings. Both the student union and rec center have been updated recently. Aggiville is 3 minutes walk from campus and full of bars, restaurants, shopping and coffee."
"Small town, happy people, but not much to do other than college sports games and local bars."
"Great way to meet friends freshman year, but it is overpriced and administration is disorganized. I would not recommend living in residence halls more than one year."
"Officers are seen often patrolling in vehicles, but rarely are seen walking about campus."
"I lived on campus my first two years and loved it. I was an RA during the second year, so I know a lot about housing and dining. Compared to other universities, we have amazing residence halls. I like Kramer complex the best. It has both suites and community style living, and I recommend community style living. Each wing has a shared bathroom which is cleaned every weekday. You make friends while living on campus and there is always something going on and/or people available to hang out with. Cluster floors are nice for people studying within the same area."
"We have a parking garage right by the union but it normally fills up pretty fast. If you have a morning class, driving to campus is easy and there are still plenty of open spots. If you park somewhere not allowed by your permit. You will get a ticket though guaranteed. Personally I walk to campus."
"I'm not involved in Greek life, but I know people that are. You are required to live in house your sophomore year and most people that are involved really enjoy it, but it isn't my thing. There are a lot of fees involved."
The guys and girls at my school really vary between social groups.
"Campus is really strict about drug usage (especially in residence halls). If you park in the wrong place, you will get a ticket. Other than that, it isn't to strict. You can have visitors in the residence halls at any time."
Housing works with you to improve your experience. I never had a problem when I lived there.
"Depending on which permit you get, parking can be pretty hassle-free. The freshman parking is pretty crowded all the time. Other lots are sometimes impossible to find a spot during normal hours, but others are fine. There are plenty of options for all permits other than freshman permits, but you may have to park a little far from class."
"There are plenty of computer labs. The dorm internet can be a little shotty, but it's enough for necessities."
"Not all facilities are brand new, but they're more than adequate."
"Campus is beautiful. There's plenty of benches, trees, and soft places on the lawn. The library is huge and a common meeting point for students. The union is a great place to hang out as well. It's got pool tables and bowling. There are many events to go to other than sports."
"For the dining complexes on campus, you have to be living in the dorms and buy a meal plan at the beginning of the year. Other than that, there's only the student union with about 10 restaurants and a coffee shop."
The department gives you a lot of opportunities for scholarships. They also alert you of applicable outside scholarships.
"Getting around town isn't a problem, but Manhattan is pretty remote. Unless you know someone to give you a ride, it's difficult to get out of town without a car of your own."
I've wanted to come to K-State starting at age 8. It's everything I thought it would be and more.
You just feel at home in Manhattan.
"The Animal Science department is the best on campus. All of the staff and professors are very helpful and you can tell that their main interest is your success. Although the facilities may not be brand new, like the Leadership Building, they are still adequate."
There are many options and all of the professors are great at what they do.
"I don't go to many sports, but I hear good things about the programs here."
"There's a lot of trees to block some of the rain. The policies about severe weather are strict and very helpful. While the wind may get a little strong, there are plenty of buildings to help block it out. Plus, the campus is relatively small and not spread out like other Kansas colleges."
"It's a pretty safe place. Walking alone is nothing to worry about during the day, but it is a little frightening at night because of a recent spike in crime on/near campus. We do have escort services, though. I believe K-State is doing everything it can."
When people talk about Greeks they typically mention the parties
"There are very few shuttles or mass transit on campus, however the few we have are free."
"KSU is very accepting and the dorm floors are, for the most part, very accepting of peoples' different life styles."
The need for a car on campus is nonexistent. The only way a car is needed is if you would want to leave Manhattan otherwise everything else is within walking distance.
The social life at KSU are very vibrant and always fun to participate in.
"The sporting events are amazing, and are definitely fan driven. Coach Bill Snyder definitely takes a lot of pride in his team."
The dorms are quite nice. The community in the dorms is fantastic and there is a brilliant floor camaraderie.
"Transfer credit is not widely accepted at KSU. It may take some persistence to get financial aid, but it is possible."
"It's definitely interesting. It's typical Kansas weather, so you can experience all 4 seasons in one day. It can be a very fun experience though."
It is by far one of the most friendly places I have been to. It was recently rated one of the top 10 most friendly campuses in the US.
"The campus library is amazing, it is large with many areas dedicated to study, it also has many computers and printers for all students."
They have security cameras posted around campus. There are help phones placed around campus if something goes wrong. The campus pathways are well lit.
I would say that the most lenient area is class attendance since there are some instructors that do not take attendance and some that do not care.
"Some of the intro professors are a bit spotty, but that is to be expected at a large university. However, they still attempt to help students, and there are office hours set up to where students can receive one on one help from the instructor. They also have many tutoring sessions open to all campus students throughout the week, as well as review sessions before major tests."
"Engineering at KSU a major part of the campus. There are two major career fairs at the college(one in the fall and the other in the spring) , the spring one is strictly for engineers. It is definitely one of the more difficult majors at KSU, but it is also one of the most rewarding. There are great opportunities for KSU engineers. The placement rate in 2013 for graduating seniors was 100%."
There are various dining halls that are all positioned closely to the living area of the dorms. The food is well prepared and there are decent hours to dine given. The staff is also very friendly.
"The campus dining selection is alright. Although, I have not eaten at the dinning halls, because I do not live on campus. The dinning hall cost is the main reason I chose not to live on campus. It is too expensive for a person who does not eat a whole lot. The student union provides a few options. The cost is about the same cost you would pay going out to eat. Although, they do provide a healthy option with a salad bar, it is more expensive than going to Panda Express. I believe they should offer healthier options at a lower cost."
"The average cost of an apartment off campus currently costs about $600-$800. Most apartment complexes do not offer one bedroom apartments, and if they do it seems to have very little square footage, with almost the same cost of a two bedroom with apartment, with very little amenities. They do provide one apartment complex that seems very nice, if you do not mind sharing an apartment with several other people. University Crossing provides several amenities, as well as furnished apartments. Also, this complex is extremely close to campus."
"The college of business building is currently a little run down They are working on a new building. The student union looks amazing; it is clean, and large enough for many students. Plus, on the top floor there is a place to read and study when you want to get away from the loud main floor. Also, on the lowest level of the student union they offer a lace for students to have fun, and hang out, the bowling alley. On weekends they provide movies that cost about two dollars to view. The campus is usually kept tidy, and they provide a few recycle bins by the trash cans. The KSU campus provides a great place to learn and have fun."
"Kansas State University (KSU) provides a program for business students to increase the knowledge and real world advice. This program is not offered at any other school. They have one of the top rated accounting programs, which is why I chose this school. They also provide an executive mentor program which will really help with connections, and learning what you should be doing."
"Kansas State University (KSU) does not provide very many options for student transportation. They recommend students own a car or at the very least a bicycle. Although KSU does not provide a transportation system, Riley County provides an bus that will take students on fixed routes to specific stores, like Target and Dillon's. The bus also provides transportation to apartment complexes, like University Crossing. The average cost of taking the bus is one dollar per trip. It seems necessary to own a type of vehicle yourself."
"Parking kind of sucks. I have to leave my apartment 30 minutes before class to even think about getting a spot, then I usually have to wait for someone to leave."
"The girls at K-State are awesome! There are so many dimes everywhere you go, and most of them are very friendly and willing to talk to you."
K-State is a very diverse campus. Everyone is treated equally.
"I'm in Wildlife and Outdoor Enterprise Management. It's the only program of its kind in the world and truly unique to K-State. The faculty are great, and I have truly found my calling."
"I am extremely happy with my program (Wildlife and Outdoor Enterprise Management). I want to own a five-star hunting and fishing resort, and have no problems finding jobs in my career path."
"K-State has awesome facilities. A lot of new buildings, and they are constantly updating the old buildings. There's a lot of history on campus."
"The student union is a great place to eat, study, have meetings, and interact with your fellow students and faculty. There is a recreation center (bowling, pool tables, shuffleboard, arcade) downstairs. The campus rec complex was just updated and is absolutely massive, with an indoor rock-climbing wall, and more machines to get in summer shape than you could ever dream of."
"Manhattan is a great college town. I've lived here my whole life and love the community, the people, and the nightlife!"
"Yes, a million times yes! K-State has a unique family atmosphere that very few schools can come close to."
Varsity athletics are a huge deal. but we have one of the best club sport programs in the nation. I am a part of one club sport and joining was the best decision I've made at K-State.
"Campus dining is awesome! Some of the best dining halls in the country, and our union food court is great as well."
Weather is OK here. We get every season and some years are better than others.
"Of course, when the library is packed, the Internet is going to be deathly slow, but if you stop procrastinating and study, it won't be as big of a deal!"
Fantastic! The financial aid office is very helpful!
"Some students use drugs, but the hard stuff isn't as common. Of course, you're going to find it anywhere you go, though."
"Some things they are way more strict on, but K-State has a very laid back atmosphere."
"Off-campus dining is fantastic. A great variety of local restaurants, many of which are absolutely delicious!"
"Campus housing is great, but I'd opt for off-campus."
"K-State is well known for its friendly, and outgoing students."
"Campus housing is close to most classes, but not a very good value. The facilities have not been updated in years. Student life in the dorms is thriving, however. I have met some of my best friends on my dorm floor, especially my roommate."
"K-State has the worst wifi known to man. There are some who don't bring their own computers, but it is a hassle to have to go to the library or find a lab to get assignments done."
Don't like the weather in Kansas? Wait five minutes.
"There are some great new facilities (the union, the rec center), and others that haven't been touched in years and need work."
"Student life is awesome. Most is centered around sports, but many students spend time at the library or the new recreation center."
Getting into my program seems easy and I am confident that I will complete the courses in my program with ease.
"There are safety services and campus police around, but they are rarely seen."
Campus administration has a serious thing about the honor code. Other than that most issues they are pretty average about.
Awesome food. Especially holiday dinners.
I believe because of my achievements in high school I should have been given more money in scholarships.
"Not involved in Greek life, but it is very prevalent. They are responsible for most of the parties."
Average for a college town. Most desirable homes/apartments are by aggieville
I've had lots of success with professors and maintaining a comfortable workload.
"Program is fairly easy freshman and junior year. Even gen eds are aimed specifically at my major, which keeps my interest."
"K-State is a big family and full of spirit, along with a tradition for academic success. I could not see myself anywhere else."
There's free shuttle service on the weekends.
"Lots of partying and alcohol present. The school provides safe transportation, but does little to prevent students from accessing drugs and alcohol."
People come to KState just for the sport atmosphere.
Manhattan is mainly known for sports and KState games.
Lots of local spots in aggieville but plenty of chains and fast food as well.
"Professors are very welcoming and accepting, but there are many closed minded conservative students throughout campus."
"The busses on campus don't run frequently enough to be worthwhile, but if it something that you have to do to get around, it will work, as long as you don't mind waiting. But you should definitely have a car for shopping trips as the on campus convenience stores are outrageously priced and don't have a great selection."
"When the weather is warmer, campus is gorgeous and really fun to be out and about in. When it gets colder and snowy, though, it has been really hard for me to make myself go to classes. The facilities people do a great job of keeping campus clean and keeping the roads and sidewalks plowed and shoveled, but I feel like I would have done better at a school that stays warm all year if I was able to afford it."
"The school has a majority of white, higher-income students, with I believe 11% african-americans. Our international student population is higher than all other minorities combined. Most students are white, and it is weird because I came from a very diverse high school."
"I am not a greek student, however, my roommates both are. As freshman in their first semester, I saw both of them party way more than should be acceptable. I do not understand the concept of greek life, as there are so many requirements. The benefits I have seen from my roommates of being in these sororities is the outrageous parties and the social status, which seems like too much work to be worth it."
"If you stay away from the bad things, it's easy to have a really safe campus experience. The rules aren't generally enforced unless there is an incident, so it's also easy to break some rules, as long as you aren't stupid about it."
"The university is so large that it offers so many affordable benefits, including the healthcare and the libraries. The library is my favorite place on campus, it's so big, and pretty!"
"As a freshman, you are required to buy the crappiest parking permit, which leaves you with two different parking lots as your options. For $170, it is crazy that we have to walk so far. These freshman ""R"" and ""Z"" lots are so far from anything that it's ridiculous to try to drive when on campus. And if you park outside of these lots, it's very likely that you will receive a citation within 3 hours of parking there."
"I don't like being told what kind of anti-virus I have to have to be able to access the wireless network, and the signal can be spotty throughout the campus, but it does the trick. The things that are supposed to be required on campus are there, so I can't complain. One thing I do love is that the newer lecture halls have outlets wired through the desks, so if you are typing notes and your computer is low, it is really convenient to plug it in right there."
"Since we are allowed to eat at any dining hall on campus as opposed to only the complex you live at, the convenience factor is up, but I do wish it were healthier and better quality."
"The workload and classes are bearable, but the amount of support from the advisor is just atrocious. I think we definitely need more than ONE academic advisor for the Journalism and mass communications major program."
"The workload and classes are bearable, but the amount of support from the advisor is just atrocious. I think we definitely need more than ONE academic advisor for the Journalism and mass communications major program."
"The atmosphere is great, but there is a definite divide between the locals and the college students. Locals rarely show up near campus, unless there is a football game. There is an elementary school literally three blocks from campus, which I would be hesitant about letting my children attend."
"With such a large campus, it can be hard to maintain a high level of safety, but we do have the ""Blue Light Poles"" which have emergency buttons and will get you campus police assistance within a minute of being pushed, and there are text message alerts every time something bad happens relatively close to campus such as an armed robbery or shooting. Since I am aware of these things, I do feel unsafe walking at night by myself and generally call someone, but the way these things are handled by campus officials is remarkable."
"The scholarship requirements for ALL undergrad scholarship recipients to keep their academic scholarships state that you must maintain a 3.5 GPA or higher. This is extremely unreasonable, especially for freshman, who are undergoing a process of change as well as more difficult classes."
"I'm from Kansas so I have a life time of bias to build my opinion from. I hate Kansas weather. When school starts it's hot and begins to cool down. Once October hits it gets colder and it might snow. In November, it will get weirdly warm outside. December will be the coldest."
I'm not greek but a lot of my friends are and they love it. There are a lot of different types of greek houses on campus. There is the Panhellenic Council (sororities) and whatever the guys are; but then there is also the National Panhellenic Council which is the african american sororities and fraternities. Most greek and non greek students get along just like students of different cultures and backgrounds. The sororities and fraternities have houses all around Manhattan but NPC chapters do not.
"It's college so students are going to drink; but only if they want to. I know I didn't drink until I got to second semester and none of my friends made me feel bad for my choice. If you know someone 21, then there are chances of you getting alcohol. If you go to a party, chances are they will have alcohol but you don't have to drink it unless you want to."
"K-State athletics is amazing. Between the Big XII championships last year and the repeated football bowl trips, basketball march madness and college baseball world series trips, the D1 sports are great here. As for intramural sports, all students who go to the rec participate and have lots of fun."
I love K-State. The people are amazingly friendly and nice. Everyone acts like a family.
"It all depends on who you know and if you want to go out. On the weekend, there is always something going on but it's not always good. Some house parties get shut down because of noise violations. Aggieville is mostly 21 and up but sometimes 18 year olds can get inside. Fraternities always have parties and have Designated Drivers to pick you up and take you to their house. If you're going to a house party you can either walk or get a friend to drive you."
I hear from others that they are happy
I have never had any problems
Friendliest campus in the nation!
Dining hall food is actually really good
It's a small city. Travel is easy
"I'm an exception; I ride a motorcycle, much better"
"had my tire slashed, campus police no help"
"I, myself, am a Greek"
really good for the size of town
exactly what i wanted in a school
exactly what i wanted in a school
the wireless could be better
Still have some questions to be answered
The town is a great part of going to K-State. The Manhattan residents are very friendly and easygoing!
I play a lot of different intramurals and it is open for anyone who wants to play and it is affordable!
"We have people from all over the world at K-State and it doesn't bother anyone in the slightest, except for when the Asians walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk."
There is tons of housing right around the campus that is within walking distance. The shopping is not very far from campus either. Manhattan is just a really great place to live!
I don't really associate specifically with the Greeks but I don't have anything bad to say about them.
My workload isn't too bad and the professors are all willing to help at any time!
We have tons of different programs with multiple people you can talk to about anything!
"I have always had my own computer so I don't use the computer labs too much, but they are nice!"
I get a scholarship from K-State every semester depending on my grades and it is automatically placed in my account. All my other scholarships are accepted and offset the cost of going to K-State.
It was way better than I expected it to be!
The social life at K-State is awesome. It is easy to meet people!
"I just hate walking to class in the snow, but the sidewalks are usually cleared off pretty quickly!"
I've honestly never used it. I just normally walk or I have my own car.
"I am underage, but I have heard repeatedly the bars in Aggieville are a blast! I go to Dirty Dawgs quite and bit and we always have a good time while were there. The parties get a little wild and thats just how I like it! You meet so many new people, but also run into a bunch of people you already know!"
"The campus is absolutely beautiful, especially in the fall! The buildings are also nice. We have tons of opportunities for about anything you could imagine on campus."
The rec center has been newly renovated and it is spectacular!
"You can get some scholarships. But if you want to pay for school completely, look for some scholarships outside of the school"
"The res halls are a pretty popular option. In fact, they had to make a new rule this year. If you have been a student for 6 or more semesters, you can't live in the res halls. This was because they needed to clear space for freshman, so the freshman could enjoy that community feel the first couple years too."
"If I had to do it all over again, I would totally choose K-State with way more assurance. I have enjoyed my college here so much, and I really know that I am in the right place."
"If you follow regular laws, you will be perfectly fine. The police are pretty understanding of when to step-in and when not to. If you aren't a jerk to them, you will be fine."
"It's Kansas, the weather changes all of the time. The state's weather is pretty unpredictable and extreme. However, campus does a great job of being prepared for everything thrown its way."
"There's not really a drug problem. If you're a drugee, usually you won't make it in college. However, a fair amount of students do drink and that is pretty prevalent. It's really all about who you surround yourself with. You can find people who party or people who don't. The campus ministries are great, and you can find some great people to surround yourself with from them."
"You'll probably want a car or a friend's car to get around town. However, a lot revolves around the campus, so you really don't need to get around town much. You can simply walk to a lot of the stuff."
"Well we were just named the 8th fittest college in the country this year, so I guess that says something. Everyone really supports the football team. We have a pretty much brand new rec that was recently renovated. And intramurals are highly participated in, we even have things like intertube water polo and underwater basket-weaving."
"There has been a lot of alumni donations recently, and that is really helping to enhance facilities and even create new ones. The limestone is the traditional look of campus, and since every building uses it for its exterior, campus have a uniform look that really grows on you. Football games are huge! And it seems that almost everyone goes and gets into it, I'd encourage to do the same."
"Just the people, the people are incredibly friendly. You have so many alumni that are doing so much to support the school that it really is helping the school constantly improve its academics and facilities. It's a college town, so you have plenty of options for college students."
"I'd say it's all about your friend groups that you develop. If you are coming for parties, you'll find them. If you want to stay away partying, you will find plenty of great friends and enjoy your time too. If anything, I would encourage everyone to come and focus on developing friendships first."
"The engineering program at K-State is highly regarded for how well it prepares its students for industry. That being said, employers love coming to campus to hire the hardworking students coming out. However, this all stems from a tough engineering workload. You don't have to be a genius, but be prepared to develop a good work ethic."
"The professors and faculty at K-State are super nice and helpful. They really go out of their way to help us out, and they truly care about us and what happens to us. I love the staff at K-State."
"The town and K-State are perfect for each other. Everyone in town is a K-State fan, and all the people who live in town love having the college students and do a lot to help them out."
"You have a variety of options even late at night, and it all is generally pretty easy to afford."
"It's much cheaper to live off-campus. However, you won't be living in super nice houses."
"Generally speaking, K-State has some of the nicest people you will meet in general. The reason a lot of people come to K-State is how nice people were on their visit. Something about growing up in rural settings make the people extremely friendly."
"Dining centers are essentially all you can eat buffets, and the quality of food is generally pretty good."
"The greek life at K-State is a little different than I had pictured. There are a few houses that actually focus on developing the character of their members. Also, the average GPA's and campus involvement is much higher in the greek system."
"Campus is pretty safe. If anything, I'd recommend not walking alone at night if you are a girl."
"It's really not necessary to bring your own computer, since there are so many computer labs on campus. However, it doesn't hurt to bring your own laptop so you can work away from campus."
"There is good locations for the parking lots. However, spots can fill up fast."
There are several unique restaurants in Aggieville across from campus and some major chain and cafes around town. Most offer a student discount.
"Everyone is very friendly and inviting. Each floor in the dorms is their own little community that eats and hangs out together. The cost is a little high, but you get the value of it being safer as only those with K-State IDs can enter the buildings, you have a dining center next door, a convenience store for late night snacking, and a laundry mat."
"As I am a dual language major, my course load is not very heavy as all of my classes have a similiar tone and subject, versus some other majors where you bounce between writing and science classes. I do not have very much homework on a daily basis and do not have any lab/studio classes to deal with."
"There are over 250 major options here. The professors range from Drs in that field for the advanced courses and graduate students for the entry courses. First time registration is done with an advisor and you have an advisor who is versed on the requirements for your major to assist you. K-State has outstanding Vet Med, Engineering, and Teaching programs."
"Across the street from campus is an area called ""Aggieville"" that is home to most of the bars and decent restaurants, a few clubs, and some nifty stores."
"Kansas has weather that changes on a whim. Sometimes it will be bright, warm, and sunny one day and then snowing the next. The campus is not very large, so getting to and from classes in snowy or rainy weather isn't too bad."
"There is a campus shuttle that runs around and through campus, as well as a shuttle that goes to some popular shopping places in town such as Walmart and Dillons. There are sidewalks all over town, however some of the crosswalk lights do not work."
"I had a very easy time receiving financial aid. I had a small issue this year with not having enough financial aid to cover next semester, but the financial aid office was able to help me out and give me a small grant even though it was a little late in the semester."
"There are several options near campus for off-campus housing, lots of apartments and group houses. You have to begin looking at options about a semester in advance if you are to guarantee having it when you need it."
Students get very pumped up for football and basketball games. There is a lot of school pride here. The athletic facilities are very nice and fairly new. Our teams perform very well and have a huge support regardless of whether they win or lose.
"The wifi is a bit slow, but available anywhere on campus. There are several computer labs, some available only to students within a certain studies. Most are pretty crowded, so its nice to have your own laptop. There are printers in all of the labs and you get $10 worth of printing that most students don't use all of."
"There aren't many major attraction in Manhattan, but there are a lot of shopping centers and restaurants. The whole town is bursting with Wildcat pride and there is purple everywhere. Everyone is really involved in what the university and students are doing."
"I would choose KSU over again as the campus is beautiful. There are two registered castles on campus and all of the buildings, whether new or old, have a similar style that makes it seem like they've all been there for ages. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, especially if you've lost your way. There is always something going on on campus, whether it be a play or a movie night at the union."
"Each housing complex has its own dining hall and the menus change regularly. You can eat as much as you want. The food is really nice for a cafeteria style setting, better quality than what you would expect. However, there are not many vegetarian options."
"There are emergency phones spread out across campus, lit paths everywhere, a bus system that runs through and around campus, and an option to have someone come and walk with you at night."
Everyone has been extremely helpful in this process.
I am unclear so far on how the internship will work for my career goals. I am just starting my junior year though this Spring so I will find out more this semester.
I am an online student
Admissions staff has been very helpful.
"I like it, tuition sucks though. They are extremely expensive and so is the whole town. Definitely not worth my time and money."
"Aggieville is the best thing that has ever happened to Manhattan, Ks."
"There are things to do, but mainly just go to the mall or the movies if you are looking for off campus entertainment"
Parking is probably the strictest thing there is. In the classroom teachers are always bringing up the honor code.
Most of the greeks I have met have been snobby and act better than everyone else.
"No one likes financial aid, but KSU wasn't difficult about it."
"Parking sucks. There aren't enough spots for the people that possess a permit, and if you get a permit they are in the hundreds for cost. Ridiculous."
There are your typical fast food places but there are also pricier restaurants.
It;s very hard to find someone here that is not accepting of another group.
Dorms are great here on campus. They may not be the newest of buildings but they do provide with what they need.
Unless you're a junior or senior in college finding a good parking spot near the dorms is nearly impossible. Upperclassmen are given first choice so underclassmen don't get nearly as good of a parking spot as the older guys.
Professors for the architecture program are great and will help you in whatever field you need it in.
"With the architecture program being rated as one of the best, it is very top notch."
"Greek life isn't a big part of the college life here, but it is cool to be apart of something and to be recognized like that."
The scholarship process was integrated into the application and was fairly easy to apply for.
the weather varies quite a bit and online weather reports aren't very reliable in this area.
Computers are not necessary for campus work but they do prove to be very helpful.
There are tons of places to eat around campus.
There is always something to do around campus on weekend nights. The options do get boring after awhile.
The town and school almost really evolves around varsity athletics. Everyone supports the team no matter how bad their season is.
The food on campus is okay. There are not a ton of options. I did get tired of the repeated options.
"From what I saw over the summer, off campus housing is very popular and easily get taken so if you want something you have to start looking early"
"Best atmosphere, everyone is friendly helpful and full of school spirit! Couldn't have asked for a better school to go to! Go K-State! EMAW!!!"
"It's all about AGGIEVILLE!! Easy to get to and there's always some sort of transportation. Parties are almost always local so people are able to walk to them and coming close to risk, and if they're not, there are always designated drivers or transportation that will take us home safely."
"The police and health center are always there to my convenience. Every time I've needed either one, all I had to do was call them up and was helped within minutes."
"Sporting events are amazingly awesome!! Everyone shows school spirit, including current students, alumni, and even fans who haven't or didn't attend. Like they say, we are on BIG happy family :)"
I personally loved where I am housing because I am living in the on campus apartments but the dorms also great when I go visit someone there.
"It's a college town so there isn't much to do locally but if you drive a little more out of town, it isn't bad."
The process went smoothly and I received all the financial aid I could receive. Even though the process was time consuming it wasn't bad; just like every financial aid process.
"The wireless connection on campus can get extremely slow so it can't always be reliable especially when in the middle of taking exams or doing homework. But besides that, nothing too bad. Also, our tech support is great, they are always friendly and get the problem solved as soon and as quickly as possible."
The transportation is excellent! The school provides shuttles to all the student to place on AND off campus. This is extremely helpful for student who may not have transportation and have to go to the grocery store or mall to go buy necessities.
"The campus strictness is pretty average. They tend to be a lot more strict to things that come to being against the law like underage drinking and drug use, which is great because that's the way it should be anyways"
"The weather for the most part isn't that bad out here. The only thing that may make it hard to enjoy the campus is when it snows. It's hard to get around, takes longer and can be dangerous. But beside that, it's awesome!"
It is the perfect school for me!
"we have the best, and most helpful professors in the college of human ecology"
somewhat competitive depending on the college and department
"live in the dorms or a fraternity as freshman to meet other people, and then move to a house with those newly made friends"
typical kansas weather... more wind on campus because the wind runs between the buildings
"very exclusive for men more than women, if you are not in a fraternity it is hard to interact and get the same party opportunities"
average for what you would expect... it is kansas
"Kansas State is an amazing fit for me. I transferred from another school that I was not pleased with, and Kansas State was the best choice I could have made."
"The dining halls do have good choices but some of the meals that are offered remind be of the type of frozen product served in a high school cafeteria. The Union, however, does have a good variety but you can't use your meal plan for those vendors."
"Kansas State Dining has food for all backgrounds. It is also made by students! The food is great, and there are amazing options. Don't want one thing? You can have something else!"
Little to no drug use on campus or off. It is a great atmosphere for all students to safely have fun without being pressured into anything like drugs or alcohol.
"Aggieville is amazing, and the school is BEAUTIFUL!"
"It is rather conservative, but welcoming to all."
Kansas changes weather quickly. Be prepared!
A car is very helpful but not required
Compares well and is making great improvements
Very active and always something to do
This is definitely my school
Very similar groups of people
Very strict about the silly things and not what really matters
Winter sucks and is bitter cold but every other season is wonderful
Love my major and love the business program here
Big town easy to get anything you might want
Very close by. Just hard to get an appointment
Good options if you aren't a vegetarian
"Just okay, could be better though"
I love it here. Very old buildings adds to the character
There are many different house sizes to choose from and they range from not so nice to nice and the pricing is usually fair. There are also many apartment choices. For the most part the landlords are reasonable.
"I have not had much experience with campus strictness because I live off-campus, however I do know they are pretty strict when it comes to the parking rules and are not afraid to give tickets."
The guys have good manners and are polite. The girls are friendly. There are guys and girls who will talk in each class to those around them and some just prefer to keep to themselves.
"It's usually hard to find a spot to park, and the crosswalks are dangerous at times due to the amount of students who walk. It's not a necessity to have a car but it's convenient."
The options are limited and repetitive once you've participated in them all.
People basically look the same. There are few people that I see who have a unique look that separates them from the rest.
Involvement for students is a big deal. There are many organizations and activities for students to get involved with. The sense of community is strong as well.
"There are many traditions, in greek life and the community that everyone can participate in. In the town there are signature hangout spots for the students."
"The town is nice, but activites are limited and repetitive once you've participated in all of them."
"There is a great diversity on campus, and multiple student organizations for many religions, political beliefs, and nationalities."
"The dining hall is right outside the dorm rooms, so access is easy and convenient. You usually get satisfying portions and the options to choose from are many."
"I was given financial aid, and it helped out a lot but it still isn't enough when you factor in the student loans I will be paying back for years."
"It's uncomfortable to walk in the heat to your classes, and a little difficult to walk in the snow."
"There are usually available computers either at the library or in other labs. The wireless access, reliability and speed is relatively good. It's not a necessity to have a computer in class but it is to complete assignments and check your school email."
"It's not visible that people are using drugs if they are. Peer pressure is not really a problem, people are free to do what they want without feeling worried about what others will think and say."
Overall I think my school makes clear its values and what is accepted and what will and won't be tolerated. The honor code for plagiarism is stressed in every class and even reported on by the people in charge of the program.
"The school is fine, but I personally would be more comfortable in a smaller institution with better interaction and one on one time with professors."
"The library, halls, and most buildings all have some sort of computer lab with printing abilities. Printing on campus is five cents for b&g. If you don't have a personal computer, you can easily access one somewhere across campus. Internet access is available over the entire campus. I personally believe the wifi runs pretty slow and I've heard the same from others. The dorm rooms do offer an ethernet connection if desired."
"I am not part of the Greek community. About 20% of females are in a sorority. Most sororities have really great houses and the freshman girls all live in Ford. If you are not planning on being in a sorority, I would strongly avoid Ford as your hall."
"The drug scene is not very visible, or at least to me. I have not seen a lot of drinking, but I hear about it."
"I changed my major right before I started my first semester, and it was extremely easy."
I enjoy my program. I've met a lot students through the program. The faculty and facilities are great!
I've never felt threatened or scared for my safety.
"If I could do it all over again I would most definitely attend Kansas State University! I drive 7 hours to come to the best university in the country! When you come to K-State you will become a member of the incredible K-State family. Great atmosphere, great people, great city, great school!!"
AggieVille is always a great option!
"I love being in the residence halls, especially in the Derby complex! The residence halls offer 24 hour front desks, laundry facilities, personal thermostats, furniture, check-out items (such as... kitchen supplies, vacuums, games, sports equipment, tv checkout, etc), great lobbies, study rooms, music rooms, weight room and many other things. I also found it very easy to get involved in the hall through work and leadership. I became a Community Assistant, Floor President, and joined the Tour Team."
The academic scholarships that K-State offers are based of GPA and ACT. Most of them are renewable for up to four years. The financial aid process at K-State takes about 15 minutes to fill out and they do the rest.
"K-State offers over 250 majors, so there's something for everybody. Most of the professors are good. Registration is pretty easy."
"I'm an Industrial Engineering major. I really like the program minus calculus. The faculty is really great and the facilities are undergoing $40 million in renovations right now. The department spends a lot of time and money making sure that we students make incredible job connections while in school. As a department, we meet with an industrial engineering professional monthly to make connections, learn about the job market, and what all our degree has to offer."
K-State has a lot of sorority girls. Some good and some not.
The athletics are great at K-State! The school spirit and support at Bill Snyder Family Stadium is the best fan experience in the Big 12! Get ready to Wabash!!
"K-State has a great campus, fun residence halls, an incredible Rec Center, top notch athletic centers, and amazing students and faculty all in the great little town of Manhattan!"
K-State is great! The atmosphere is fun and incredibly friendly!
"There's a good amount of diversity on campus, but everyone seems to ""fit-in"" really seamlessly."
If you're planning on attending Kansas State University expect Kansas weather.
It's been really tough for me to get any financial aid or scholarships through this University.
"For minorities there just really isn't anything, if you go to a bar you'll find a bunch of racial discriminating rednecks."
Some students are really into the whole school spirit sort of thing whereas others just aren't.
While the Derb has good food it really doesn't have very healthy or vegan options.
"There are plenty of shuttle buses and taxis if you don't happen to have transportation of your own and live on campus. However, I have found it always best to have your own vehicle, it makes things much more easier."
"I have been pleased with the availability of computers and computer labs on campus, there are a lot in the library. However, the printing costs are rather expensive."
"There is a mall downtown and other local shops that are nice but really, all in all, there isn't all that much to do."
The school remains close to where I live and is helping me to finish my Bachelors degree which will be extremely helpful in the very near future.
"I absolutely love my specific major, the teachers are some of the best on the entire campus in my opinion. They are very professional in their classes and with their teaching. I have learned an immense amount of material from them that I will be able to use for the rest of my life."
"The School of Agriculture is arguably one of the best in the nation which is great for anyone wanting to pursue a degree in agriculture. The Spanish department has great teachers, I have been extremely pleased with all of my teachers in this department. My experience with other departments however have not been nearly as good, if you are looking to pursue a degree in music or philosophy I would go to a different school like Indiana University, home of the Jacob's School of Music."
"Off campus is rather expensive though it beats out on campus which is absolutely ridiculous, somewhere around $10,000 a semester. You should expect to pay at least $550 a month minimum for off campus in a one person apartment and its nothing fancy by any means."
It's either really hot or really cold and the wind blows strong almost all of the time. This makes for a miserable walk across campus.
In all reality there is really not that much cultural/racial diversity when compared to other schools.
"Aggieville is the place to be when you are 21 years old. Try not to go before this, because they are known to hand out many MIP and underage drinking changes."
campus health could be improved due to long waiting times and lack of walk-in appointments (which is difficult for students with out busy schedules).
we just got a new football athletic stadium this year which adds a new level of enthusiasm to our university athletics.
"new building are becoming ""LEAD"" certified to be good for the environment. campus traditions such as athletics and homecoming week are important to student life and involvement on campus. activities such as these integrate all groups of people, including all ages and majors of students on campus."
"there are many available scholarship opportunities, but awards seem to be directed toward only incoming freshman. the study abroad program was supposed to provide funding for my trip, but was unavailable to provide after already committing to my program (therefore I must come up with this extra money on my own) look out for this problem as well!"
dorm dining facilities are very good but do not offer very healthy options for students. on campus dining facilities (such as the one in the union) are convenient but they tend to be relatively expensive with mostly fast food options
"parking needs to be improved greatly before it could be considered a ""pro"" of our university"
"wifi throughout all of campus. computer labs in the library are constantly full, so provide your own computer or go to a computer lab in another building on campus if you are in a hurry"
"could be reduced, but it does not seem to be a problem in most areas of campus"
"all of campus is very close together, with a bus to take students to campus housing locations"
we could use an increase in involvement by diverse groups on campus
we have a very spirited community (especially when our team is doing very well)
expensive (but worth it) to get top amenities
relatively lenient but still keep students safe
I LOVE Manhattan. I used to live here and want to live here after graduation as well.
I have a lot of friends in greek life and they really enjoy it.
Campus is pretty compact so walking is sufficient. That and I have a car on campus so that meets all of my other transportation needs.
The food on campus is so much better than I was expecting
I feel very healthy and safe here on and off campus.
"People are allowed to get away with a couple things here and there, but other than that, they do their job."
"Being a freshman, I really don't know much about the off-campus housing, but I have heard great things."
"I didn't receive everything I needed to pay for school, so I am hopefully going to apply and receive more scholarships in the upcoming years"
I wouldn't even think about going anywhere else to go to school.
The people at K-State are amazing. I absolutely love it here.
"Just like at any other school, there are a lot of kids underage who drink. Other than alcohol though, I don't notice any other drug problems."
"I love the nightlife around campus. Whenever I have the chance to go out, I live it up!"
I love all of my floor-mates and the food is great at the dining halls.
"Hey, If you're from Kansas, or going to a Kansas school, you better be used to the weather!"
We don't really have public transportation
All of our buildings have to have some limestone.
All of our student life facilities are great
I like it but some people don't
It is a pretty far walk to anywhere
It is quite strict but you feel safe
There a lot of foreign students.
I'm not in a frat.
The computers are great but the WiFi is terrible.
It's Kansas what can you expect?
The cops just try to give tickets to everybody.
Plenty of options to make everyone happy.
The classes are hard but will pay off!
I found my girlfriend and future wife here I am happy
It's the greatest decision of my life!
This is a great school to get a degree!
"I participate in intramurals, they are great!"
A lot of options for social life.
Great classes in my program.
I am part of a sorority and it is a great opportunity.
It is hard to find a parking spot.
I live in a scholarship house and I think it's great. Everyone's nice and we have an easier time of getting involved around campus.
I think acceptance is pretty normal. Several events occur throughout the year to promote multicultural diversity.
"You can always see campus police around and there is an emergency alert system if you need help. Health care is fine, but too far away from dorms to walk easily."
"Most of the time it is great, except for when you need a class but can't get it because upperclassmen already took all of the spots."
"SO far, I love the classes and job opportunities that will be available to me."
"Greek life is fine. If you don't want to be affected by it, you can definitely avoid it. It doesn't rule college."
There are many options for anything you are in the mood for.
"I mainly walk or drive my car, so I don't need to use other transportation. A friend also usually is driving where ever you need to go."
"I think the things they are strict on are beneficial especially with the honor code, because while an XF goes on your transcript, you are making sure some of your ethics continue being good throughout college."
"I don't use my car enough to really walk very far. However, if the parking was closer to the dorms, I would use my car more. S pots get taken very quickly especially during the week. Sunday morning is one of the best times that parking spots stay open."
"There are many things to get involved in. Several majors have the opportunity for students to get involved in community service such as helping package food for children around the world. It has 5 libraries. After every football game we win, the band plays happy trails."
The campus setting is beautiful with copious amounts of trees and gardens. Sidewalks often have messages written in chalk which is a great way to spread word about the events going on around campus.
I got financial aid easily. I received scholarships from the college and recommend working hard during high school because it pays off.
"Drinking is worse on weekends, which is average because it is a college town."
The dress is often immodest at least for girls.
Financial can be beneficial only if you go after it. I feel as if our school has a lot of scholarships available but you have to search and ask constantly for assistance. There are many opportunities just not enough information available around campus to students.
The variety of off-campus dining options are average. I believe that more options could be brought to the city but it has enough that you will not get bored. Each year by the union a student organization passes out student discount books loaded with coupons for many off campus dining options.
I feel as if guys and girls at my school are the most friendly people you will meet in the nation. As far as looks and the way they dress it is average. We are in a little town in the middle or no where so to impress is the last thing on our mind unless you came from a place where impressing is the way to go. The social life is full of excitement and the majority of the relationships are positive and well kept.
Our student involvement with athletics ranges from fan support to many of people actually participating in things such as intramural sports. School spirit is beyond enormous at our school. We are proud to attend our school. Most of the athletic facilities are fairly new and if not they are in the process of getting renovated.
"Campus crime does not really occur. We have had some incidents every now and then but usually never happens again. They make sure when you first attend the campus that you about all the safety and know the service that are available to students such as SafeRide, the emergency call poles scattered around campus and important phone numbers."
Off-Campus housing is another great selection. They vary in prices but normally they are affordable and worth what you are paying. Availability is pretty decent depending on the location.
The diversity on campus is increasing in all areas. Our campus is very open and accepting to everyone. So being who you are and standing in what you believe in is not a hard accomplishment.
"Living on campus can have its pro and cons. Pros would include the social atmosphere, walking distance from classes, and studying opportunities with the peers within the dorm. Some cons could be not being as private as you may want to be or parking restrictions."
I believe the the campus strictness on my campus is fair. They are strict in the places needed such a drugs and honor code but are somewhat lenient in appropriate situations such as visitation in the dorms.
The local weather is so unpredictable and very extreme.
We have plenty of computer labs around campus but there are also over 50 computers that can be used at anytime in the library. The printing on campus is also pretty efficient. We have a printing service in our student union that print pretty much anything you need for reasonable prices. The school also rewards each student with ten dollars worth of printing to use around campus.
"The facilities of my school are up to date and if not are historic in some way. Our recreational center is newly renovated with top of the line equipment and services to students and faculty. Our library is a historic 5 floor building that provides all of the services that you need as a student such as IT help, up to date PC and mac computers with the top of the line programs, and of course librarian assistance, who not only help to find a book but they teach you about how to research for an assignment as well."
The dining halls provide a family style atmosphere by mounting televisions to watch as you eat and by having long tables that everyone can come together and eat. The menus are decent. They really don't have a variety when it comes to breakfast or lunch but normally dinner is well prepared and pretty good.
Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks as very involved in the school's activities and community service. Greeks do increase the social atmosphere of the campus but it is in a way that brings students together positively.
"It is a very friendly college town, where the student population makes up more than a half of the town."
It was not hard for me to get accepted into my program at K-State. The admission staff were a big help.
There are University Career Fairs held every semester designed to help students get internships prior to graduation date.
There are many Greek housing options available for students to choose.
Campus is super biking/walking friendly. Plus there are public buses taking students to the mall and grocery store every weekend.
"I never lived on campus so I am not exactly sure how it compares to other options. I have been in several dorms on campus and they look well maintained. Depending on the people living around you, the dorms can be very fun."
People in town are very friendly. There are several museums and parks in the area. There are nature trails around town and the scenery is very pretty. The shopping and recreation options are pretty good for a small town.
"Depending on where you look, housing can be pretty expensive but still cheaper than living on campus. The landlords are either very friendly and helpful with nicer houses or others want a lot of money for badly maintained houses. The school does put up flyers for some housing availability."
"There are always extra steps to receive financial aid but nothing impossible or too difficult. I always receive most of the aid that I need. Definitely apply for financial aid, it is worth the time."
"There are quite a few Greek houses. Greeks take part in several events and are noticed around campus. Most non-Greeks don't judge you badly if you are Greek, depending on which house you are in."
On campus alcohol and drugs are not allowed any where and the rules are strictly enforced. Many students do go to the bars on the weekends but no one under 21 is even allowed in after ten PM. There is alcohol at house parties which is where most underage drinking occurs but no one pressures other students to drink if they don't want to.
Available computers can usually be found in the library during the regular semester. During finals weeks they are usually pretty full though. The internet connection is pretty reliable in the classrooms and throughout the library. Printing does cost a bit and it is certainly cheaper to have your own printer but not necessary.
Kansas in general has unpredictable weather. I walk or ride a bike to class so the winter can be a slight challenge but if you wear the right clothes it is certainly bearable.
The performance and support of the athletics programs is excellent. There is a ton of school spirit for the sports teams. Students are very involved in the sports programs and the bars are always packed on game nights with cheering students.
Kansas State is a great college. The students and faculty are very friendly and encouraging. I like being able to take a lab class and end up friends with everyone in my group. I would definitely choose to go here again if given the choice. I haven't had a bad experience with any other students or faculty.
The police in the city and on campus are relatively strict regarding any illegal activities. The cost of parking tickets is kind of high on campus but otherwise the police just help make the campus safer.
"There are many foreign exchange students which adds more diversity to the student body. There are students representing every religion, economic background, political belief, religion and sexual orientation so there are limited challenges related to any of these in my experience."
"There could be more parking on campus to accommodate a bigger percentage of students closer to classes, but there are quite a few students and a limited amount of space to make more parking spaces. Costs for parking permits are probably average for a college campus. Ticketing and fines for parking on campus without a permit or in the wrong area are pretty high. If you live close enough to campus, riding a bike to class is much more convenient than driving a car."
There are quite a few restaurant options for students in the Student Union on campus and even a separate coffee shop on campus. The variety of food is pretty big and there are quite a few healthy options in the dining center and in the convenience store. The cost of food in the Union is decent for being on a college campus.
"Like any school there is fewer computers available than there are students so it's important to bring your own, but for the most part the wireless access is pretty stable with decent speed (depending on the building you're in) especially in the library and union."
"We had a bit of a struggle at the beginning because the school still had me listed as an out of state student even though I had already met the requirements not to be anymore. However, once we got that figured out it went much smoother. The only real issue was not the schools fault, as I am just not eligible ( on paper) for the amount of assistance I really need."
The music education program here is wonderful. I transferred from a different four year university during my Junior year and I can say with certainty that K-state has the better program hands down. The way that they structure they're curriculum is fantastic toward preparing us to teach and I love the multitude of experiences they offer as far as learning different aspects of teaching. We as a band program have the lowest budget of any Big XII school but we do more with that than any of the others. From freshman year they push you to start networking with schools to get experience in teaching and foster future employment opportunities.
"I live in a studio apartment right across the street from campus. I have a guaranteed parking spot, and the Landlord is good about fixing problems so long as you call while they are open during the week. However, Manhattan has the highest cost of living in Kansas, so living here is not cheap. I pay $560 for my apartment (which is a little studio in an old building) plus utilities. I know that the nicer apartments near campus can cost over $1,200 (usually they are 2-4 bedrooms though). So ultimately if you can find a roommate, do living here is pretty expensive and the closer you live to campus the more expensive it gets."
"It can get pretty cold in Manhattan, KS but generally the weather here is bearable. There aren't to many snow days and the summers are pretty nice as well. No 117 degree days here."
"Permits are expensive and parking is very limited. Parking regulations are taken seriously but and it can be hard to find places to park if you don't have a permit as the parking garage usually fills up, especially when it starts getting colder. Luckily, there is some over flow in Aggieville and the surrounding neighborhoods if you aren't going to be on campus for more than 3 hours at a time. Or if you are like me, and live in an apartment right across from campus and don't have to worry about it."
"Any campus with as many students as K-state has is bound to have a few that do stupid things. But overall, I wouldn't say that Kansas State has large problem with any of these issues."
"K-state is a huge campus with a wide variety of people. But with it housing such a huge sciences department I would say overall our campus is made up of some pretty bright people. Interests range from football to farming to music. With more than 24,300 from all 50 states and more than 100 countries, it's hard to narrow down what the average student looks like, is interested in or how they dress. On this campus you are simply a human with your own thoughts and opinions and that's fine by me."
"K-State has a zero tolerance policy for harassment and discrimination, that supersedes all other policies should they conflict. For me, this means that I can feel secure in the fairness of all the other policies that affect me and that I have people to go to should I have an issue with something."
"I haven't had a lot of opportunities/needed to walk alone on campus but I know that if I did, I could contact safe ride and the campus police would accompany me."
"The campus at K-State is beautiful, and everyone takes pride in it. Hale Library is a fantastic living history of Architecture, and everyone loves the ""Harry Potter"" room. (It looks like the Great Hall in the movies). At K-state we thrive on tradition, especially those centered around the amazing Bill Snyder Family Stadium. Despite the many wonderful things offered on campus however, most students prefer the fun to be had in Aggieville. Which is the bar/shopping district less than 2 minutes walk from campus."
The school has everything I need for a great education
"You are within proximity of the classes you are and will take. You, also, have other students around you with similar fields of study and/or a diversity. International students have to opportunity to stay within the dorms or the university apartments. If you like to have a place off of campus the options are there."
"There are endless options to choose from and every meal has some different ethnic foods to eat. You can go back in line as many times as you want under one price. In addition, there are hardly any concerns with food quality."
"The drivers are great in picking up and dropping off students at the designated locations. Furthermore, the saferide provided at night for students who socialize at the bars, is a big help to the community in reducing DUI incidents."
I have seen a good amount of close housing options but I live much further.
Have not actual been to a dining facility but I have heard it is good.
Great program and the teachers and fellow students are helpful and passionate about the program.
"Friendly and diverse. Love the student environment,"
Like most universities the students accept diversity and carry on without a thought on the matter.
Have not started yet but extremely excited to start.
Needs more parking closer to classrooms. Free parking far from campus is far and few between if you don't feel like driving in circles.
"Hot in the summer, Cool in the fall and winter. Great change of season for walk campus and enjoy some outside studying."
Normal process for a university.
Great Atmosphere for athletes. Large student and alumni following
Good quality. Typical computer labs for a university
Not yet old enough to get into the bars or clubs so not sure about them but there are a lot of them in Aggieville. There is one underage club but mostly we party at frats and house parties.
Everyone is actually really down to earth and are incredibly friendly.
Classes here are a lot easier than my teachers made it sound like it high school.
"I love my major in Family Studies and Human Services I have yet to be fully immersed into the program but I have seen an outline and it looks great, you get the option of picking a concentration too. I chose mine to be in Social work."
It's a really nice atmosphere. I personally have a problem with the strictness here since I have yet do run into any conflict over it. Everyone here seems pretty laid back for the most part.
"Business ethics and commercial advertising is interesting to me.
The advertising market depends on those two things."
"My program is easy to get into. I have taken a non-traditional approach to going to school, based on my parents careers. Because this my second minor it wasn't that hard for to enroll."
"The most unique thing about where I live is that there are two nationally accredited schools to earn a bachelor's degree from, Kansas State University and Manhattan Technical Institute."
"Campus activities and college age students run my community.
I like living in a college town, mostly because we have two colleges and good sports to watch."
"Here in Manhattan, KS weather means a lot to someone's college time.
Severe weather here in Kansas affects small jobs, and everything around our community."
All campus policies should be kept strict. Following school policies are the key to success.
"Restaurants and dining at home are average, for a town with two colleges."
When I go to college I usually don't live on campus.
"Off campus living is not very over priced, but if you live at home and go to school where I live is probably just the same as living in the dorms."
Campus life and culture here is very diverse. The Midwest is the more diverse than ever.
"Local atmosphere for my town is cool, especially with College Prowler."
There is very good and convenient parking at my school.
"Nightlife is always good in my town, especially if you are a hometown hottie."
In my town transit is very busy. There are a good amount of public buses and adequate campus bus systems.
College is fun. If college isn't fun to someone then they should fill out more scholar ships and study more often. I have a 3.0 and when I graduate my next degree hopefully I can increase my career options and earn myself a good job.
Fraternities and sororities and always an option but I live at home.
My technical schools has good programs and outstanding facilities and facilitators.
"This is my second minor degree, so my next degree is definitely going to be unique."
"I am new to my school, I prefer to eat at home for my dining experience."
"Financial aid is essential for me at this part of my post-secondary education. Federal student loans are more difficult these days to consolidate, because there aren't that many jobs available. I enjoy writing and doing artwork, which is what I am going to school for.
Tips for getting financial aid, it takes time."
Campus security is prevalent and quite aware. In the community that I live in crime is regular but not too overbearing. I feel safe in the college life experience that I have planned for me.
"I do not use drugs and alcohol, especially at school. College life is constantly affected by drugs and addiction, which is one reason that I am on to my fourth college degree."
"At the current school that I am enrolled at there aren't any sports programs offered. Technical schools here in Kansas are very good with internships and job placement, but don't offer too much sports programs."
"Typical campus life is pretty normal where I'm from.
Main campus life is all about sports. Usually students get along and coerse normally among my school and surrounding areas."
"I really enjoy graphic design. I earned my first professional technical school certificate in may 2013. My next certificate is going to be in business administration. My ultimate career goals are to be an independent artist and to also work for a professional advertising firm.
My main concern through this site is to accumulate a financial aide to help me get a second degree from an accredited technical school."
"I have never had a paid internship before. Internships should involve a lot of careful planning. If you get grades through a traditional college atmosphere, then an internship is probably a good choice. Getting my second minor degree, an internship wouldn't really be necessary.
In the socioeconomic ladder an internship to me is defined as a"
"Although not a big city, Manhattan has plenty of places to eat if you want to switch things up. There are plenty of ethnic restaurants as well as your bar and grill spots."
I have about a 10 minute walk to campus. I always have parking right outside my house and I am not far from anything it seems.
"Kansas weather is very unpredictable. It is either windy, raining, steaming hot, or a blizzard. It is very hard to find a perfect day to walk to campus. But when it does get nice, people are everywhere outside doing activities."
"For the most part, Kansas State is a pretty big party school. I would not say there is a huge drug problem though. Mostly just alcohol."
"For the most part KSU is a predominantly white campus. I would say though, everyone is very welcoming and considerate to people of any ethnic background."
The dining hall was one of my favorite parts about the dorms as a freshmen. So many options and fairly good food. Also the restaurant options in the union are numerous as well.
The parking on campus is very difficult. There are limited spots and the permit is too costly for me to even consider.
"Although the Kansas State campus is very large, I have always felt safe walking through it. There are plenty of emergency call stations located around campus. Also you can call an officer to escort you to anywhere on campus if you feel the need."
"The campus police are usually friendly, although they do take noise complaints very seriously and seem to love to ruin parties."
"Although I have not used the shuttle system on campus, I see it all the time. I have heard people talk about how convenient it is for them."
"Manhattan is your classic college town. The bar district, Aggieville, is one of the best in the country. There is plenty to do and always something happening. Yet it is small enough to get that home town feel."
"I have not gotten too deep in the Accounting program yet, I have found I really enjoy it and the professors are always ready to assist me with my needs."
"Although I work every summer, I have not had an actual internship yet. I do plan on finding one in the future because I believe they are very beneficial."
"The Kansas State campus makes the college experience complete. From the newly renovated Recreational Center, to the always hopping student union, there is always something going on across campus."
"Being a couple hours away from Kansas City, you will find a mix of people at Kansas State. You have the city people right along with your small town folk. Either way, most everyone is friendly and easy going."
The on campus dorms are close to all classes and really allow you to meet new people by getting you involved with activities and social events.
"Manhattan, Kansas is a very small geographic area so the restaurant options are small and does not vary much, but they are affordable."
"The campus at Kansas State University is strict in the idea that the campus is thought of as an environment of deference, so any variables that does not reflect those constructs are absent. Information in a variety of forms are dispersed throughout the college to offer options to avoidance as well as being aware of the negative consequences of under age drinking, drugs and also alcoholism."
"The drug scene epithet does not apply to the campus at Kansas State University, it has a very low visibility even if it exist in pockets of students."
Computers are always available but most do have their own laptop with access to moderate Wifi with decent access only in 'hotspots' in the dorm halls. The computer labs that are available in the dorm halls are to great use with free printing whereas labs around the school cost $.10 a page.
"Greek life offers numerous study sessions and gatherings at restaurants for dining once a week. They try to include as many as possible, even if you are not apart of the fraternity or sorority. Greek students on our campus are full of energy and enthusiasm which is motivating and always a good time."
"I received a decent amount of financial aid, but not nearly as much as I was informed I was able to receive. Also, I wasn't offered a financial aid officer after arrival, all the applying was just me and my mom."
There are many available restaurants around where most are affordable although not many offer student discounts.
"The financial aid office has always been courteous, personable and helpful in their customer service. The student staff at the front desk have always stayed focused on the problem or concern that I have had

and brought in the supervisor when they had done all they could to make sure any questions were answered correctly and everything possible had been done."
"The process to get into Veterinary Medicine is hard, it challenges us as students to really strive to do our best. We have to get or have a 3.5 or higher along with many experiences that go with working with animals. There are many applicants trying to get into vet school here and you really have to try your best to stand out so they have a good interest in your potential in becoming a veterinary."
"It is not that crazy bi polar, it goes through the seasons gradually, you will have a rain shower once in a while, but most of the time it stays in the degree where the season should be. People dress accordingly and either get bundled up or during hot season go play sand volley ball at all ends of the night."
"Football at K-State is huge, we are terrible at the sport it self yet every body in ingulfed in it. The volleyball games are free and typically get free shirts, we have championships in Basketball and Baseball. We also have sports that you wouldnt think of like, water skiing and sky diving. But we also have a fantastic women rowing its growing and growing every year."
"There are many different cultural groups and clubs, and lots of international students that are very friendly. Everyone is like a family, we all look out for each other. We are friendly to even our rivals. The student body for the most part is great and so are the professors they are knowledgable and will do anything for a student who needs help. If there is a question they can't answer they will find the person who can. The greek life here is awesome its not styerotypical, they are nice people and proud to be apart of an awesome organization, they have job and career oppertunities always avaiable, and over 100 different majors and minors."
"My lame amount of aid money is FAFSA's fault, not K State's. The financial aid office is extremely helpful, especially Larry Mater. They are always willing to go out of their way to help you out."
"An absolute nightmare. I wish I had not paid for a parking pass, the only way I ever get a spot is by getting on campus by 7 am or earlier."
"It is fairly easy to walk most places, but the town has no public transit, so get used to walking a lot!"
There are people of many ethnicities at K-State and they seem to comprise about a third of the student population.
"I received a goodly amount in scholarships from K-State, in particular the disability department."
"Athletics at K-State are wonderful. Not only are our varsity teams well supported, but there is an enormous gymnasium and natatorium free for all students."
Many places around town offer discounts for students and there is a variety of places to pick.
I have only heard about people drinking off campus and about parties but never see people drink or use any drugs on campus
The parking would be better if the garage was available to students with an rfid tag and closed to the public first so that students who spend money on this tag are not being charged by the hour while people from the public can come pay by the hour.
"The nightlight is mostly for students who are 21 or older. For students who are younger, it is fun to go to house parties where you can actually get into. Nightlife on campus isn't the greatest, but it's still nice for those who like to study at night and do their homework."
"I appreciate the aspects of my program. I am able to experience different things in my field, in addition, to the friendly staff. Furthermore, there are always options to improve and explore what is in store in my department."
"Athletics are phenominal. The university has grown up on itself to becoming one of the best even before the advancements in its athletic facilities. Everyone there feels like ""Family""."
"Internships allow the students to observe entry level occupations and perform their responsibilities. Furthermore, the student(s) will develop an understanding of what the company stands for and what approaches they are on for the future."
"Parking here is pretty good. Many parking lots are free on the weekends for parents and friends. Parking police are very watchful, but they will listen to circumstances before giving you a ticket."
I have seem almost no drugs or alcohol activity in my school. The main focus is on education.
"I am extremely happy with the engineering program here at Kansas State University. The class work is fun and engaging and the educators know what they are talking about. As a bonus, I have companies scouting me just for being an engineer from Kansas State."
"I have been extremely satisfied with my education thus far at Kansas State University. The faculty and staff all genuinely care about your success as well as including you as a member of the ""family."""
As an engineering there are few choices better than Kansas State University. It is an internationally ranked school for engineering courses. The only downside I can find is the lack of accommodation to those who wish to pursue medical degrees.
"The educators here as Kansas State University genuinely care about your educational performance. Professors at Kansas state make time, usually during office hours, to answer questions you may have. They also have a free tutoring system for students who desire extra help in certain courses but cannot make adequate time to see the professor for assistance."
"I feel safe on KSU's campus. There is very little theft. Campus Security has emergency buttons throughout campus, so if anyone is feeling unsafe, they can push the button and wait by it for campus police to come. Campus police will also walk anyone up to two blocks off campus grounds."
There are many places to go and places to hang out.
Parking is okay but could definitely be improved on. Cost is also too high.
Being an animal science major was an excellent experience. There are so many classes and great professors available. The veterinary program is also pretty good.
There are many outdated facilities that need a lot of maintenance and repairs. Many classrooms are old and climate control is poor. Campus is very beautiful but the buildings do not updated.
"There are many different options available for students, but I'm not sure that they are above and beyond any other school. There are over 400 student organizations so there are plenty of ways for students to get involved."
"The veterinary curriculum is fairly good. There are some areas lacking, but for the most part it is a good academic school."
"Manhattan is the friendliest place I have ever lived by far. On campus and off everyone supports everyone else. The town loves the K-Staters and we love them. It's a small town, close to a military base, with a large campus so the community is very diverse and I love it."
"As a music major there is nothing quite like marching onto the field of a sold out Bill Snyder Family Stadium at half-time to a roar that you can feel in your stomach. Where people view the band on par with football team. K-state is a place where athletics and the arts can co-exist and support each other rather than put the other down. An experience that you rarely find in other colleges, and I've attended three different colleges."
"K-State has a wide variety of people! You can find any and all groups that you are interested in joining or are already a part of! Manhattan is a large city with a small town feel. Both the boys and the girls are VERY polite, I feel safe at all times."
"Computers are great and up-to-date. They offer both PC and Macs at many locations, as well as printing services. The only thing that stinks is their security software Trend Micro... terrible"
I was a Family Studies undergrad. You take a semester course that allows you to explore a wide variety of potential internship sites to find the best fit for you. Then you get to have an entire semester at your site. Some even get paid!
"(Fan Support)
To go to a football game or volleyball game, and sit in the student section is quite an experience. You feel like you're 'one' with your fellow students. It's amazing."
"As a full-timer employee at KSU, one benefit that is offered is 3 credit hours of academics per semester. I took advantage of this and it opened the door for the possibility of my pursuing a degree in higher education I always dreamed of going to college and with the tremendous help and support of the staff and faculty at Kansas State University and the diversity of classes, my dream has come true."
I have never felt unsafe on K-state or MCC campus. Both campuses provide security and make me feel safe.
"Weather is not a factor, because I am able to walk to class. Classes hardly ever gets cancelled."
"Christian College, so we stress Christianity. We do however have diversity, we have catholics, non-denomonational, and even non-believers that attend our school . As far as race is concerned we have a variety of races and ethnicities."
"The workload for the Engineers can be pretty heavy, and the classes themselves are not generally seen as easy, but the payoff is better in the long run. There are many tools to help you succeed as well, such as: the study rooms, the private library, the Students Assisting Scholars tutoring. Plus, there is a second career fair just for engineers in the spring. It is not unlikely to have a job lined up prior to graduating."
"The people are pretty diverse. K-State is an agricultural school, so you'll get many truck-driving, two-stepping, down-to-earth hard workers. K-State is also an engineering and architecture, so you'll get many geeky individuals that barely get a break during the week, so when it's the weekend these people really know how to party. Whether it's booze or LAN or both, there's always something going on somewhere."
"Lots of resources at your disposal, but actually knowing all that they are can certainly be a challenge. There's not any sort of outline consisting of everything. Figuring out what works best for you can be it's own ordeal, but learning of all there is to offer shouldn't be."
"Strict laws or restrictions aren't really enforced, obviously students here are adults and can make their own decisions, but stopping drug use and underage drinking will always be a continuous fight."
Whenever there was an accident on campus or some emergency the police or fire department was on the scene very quickly
"There is not that much drug usage out in the open, but if there is something strange going on the police normally are moving in on it or have moved on it and it gets SHUT DOWN!"
There are a lot of different cultures. We have a lot of student exchange students that come from all over. A great majority come from China and India. We have students from all sorts of life. A lot of students on campus all come from different spiritual walks and there are plenty of different churches and groups to get involved with. Even if you don't believe in anything people are generally really nice. For sexual orientation there is a couple of bars that have gay nights and every year there is a drag queen show on campus that sells out almost every year so far. I say people are more accepting and there is quite a community.
"There are computers available in a lot of the buildings, it just depends on which one you go to. The library has the most available. There are both Macs and Pcs. Every semester, you get $10 in free printing at the library. If you live on campus, the wifi isn't that good. I suggest getting an Ethernet cable. Having you own computer and printer make doing assignments and printing them off easier and saves time."
"I love Aggieville, it is always a great time, and its never really too crowded."
"All of the students are generally nice, and easy to talk too. The teachers are understanding but still push you to be better."
"I always have access to some kind of computer lab, and the dual monitors are a nice touch."
"Even though a good majority of students on campus are from Kansas, there is a wide range of races and religions on campus."
Beautiful old Gothic and Renaissance Revival buildings. Many brand new sports facilities. Newly remodeled recreation center.
"The bar scene ""Aggieville"" is right across the street from campus and there are more than 15 bars, pubs, and clubs to choose from. There are rarely cover charges."
The majority of the students on campus are white and share similar religious beliefs.
"Everyone at KSU is very full of school spirit, and everyone seems to get along well. The Big 12 Football and Basketball team do a lot to bring together the entire university!"
"The computer labs are located all over campus and printing is fairly cheap. However, I got a laptop and printer for graduation, so I haven't really needed to use them."
"I haven't had to find off-campus housing yet, but my previous roommates did. It took them a total of two weeks to find their apartment. It's in a safe location and close to campus. It's reasonably-priced as well."
"Manhattan isn't a very large town, but there is a lot to do. There's always reasonably-priced events happening at K-State for students, like theater productions, sports games, and club activities. It's very easy to get involved"
"Yes, I like the business program. It is very involved."
"I'm pretty happy with my program right now, It is very demanding but every program is."
There are a bunch of opportunities for internships around manhattan and through the school.
Not many transportation options. It would be best if you had your own vehicle or had a roommate with a car.
"It's not a big deal if you don't join a Greek house at Kansas State University but is a great thing. The Greek system gives back so much to the community of Manhattan. Greeks are not viewed bad by non Greek students from what I've scene. Greeks can live in the Greek house, in the dorms or their own place."
I'm a Kinesiology student and it is a great and interesting field of study. The professor at Kansas State University are great very knowledgeable and fun.
From what I have notice at Kansas State University is that there is not a really big problem with drugs. People there do have a good time but more with just drinking
Kansas State University has many different programs of study and is a great campus. The professors are great and really help work with you. Hale Library is an awesome place to study and you will see a bunch of students there.
"It's Kansas! There is sun, snow, rain, hail....everything and at any time of the year! Bring your rain boots and jackets! Also they never give out snow days!"
"Parking costs about $180 for the year, but the parking lot is far from the dorms. It is hard to get close spots. Most places you could walk to though."
"There is ALWAYS stuff to do. Sometimes I find it hard to stay in and get my work done, but it is exciting. There is stuff on campus and off, whatever you're up for."
Most people here are very good looking. Everyone takes sports very seriously at K-State so as you can imagine there are basketball and football guys galore. All great looking! Girls are pretty too. There is a mix of city and country guys and gals.
"The options available for off campus dining are great. The only fallback is that some of the best places to eat are not so near to campus. The plus side is that there are shuttle buses that can take people further into town, and there are also safe walking trails that lead to the main hot spots in town. The side walks are kept up and are always being used. There are many diverse options when it comes to dining. Whether it be pizza, subs, chinese, bar-b-q, or something a little fancier, Manhattan has it."
"I think Manhattan is a fairly safe place. I worked for the Housing and Dining department for 3 years and the campus police are very helpful in educating students about the dangers of parties and other events at night. Manhattan offers a unique experience called AggieVille. While AggieVille offers many bars, there are also some really good restaurants as well as coffee shops and local stores. It is a fun place to hang on the weekends, but it is also patrolled by caring officers who are looking out for the students there."
"The facilities at KSU are great. Renovations and improvements are constantly happening to make it even better. The buildings are kept up as are the grounds. Campus life is great because of the people who invest their time into programs available for every type of person. There are many social programs as well as athletic, religious, political, and academic."
"The Housing and Dining program At K-state is great. There are 9 very diverse dorms across campus. Some dorms are all-female, others are for upperclassmen, while some are heavily filled with international students. The Housing and Dining services try to offer options for every kind of person. There are programs within the dorms for students to get involved in based on their own personal interests. There is definitely a place for everyone."
"At KSU there are hundreds of international students. These students live in the dorms often times among American students. There are many programs and events to help the International students transition to the US, but also there are many events and programs that help the American students learn about other cultures. International students get to play a part in educating the American students about their culture and heritage. Not only is KSU accepting of ethnic diversity, it is also accepting of people with different political and religious beliefs as well as different economic backgrounds."
"KSU's campus life is very unique. As you walk across campus anytime of the day, the people there smile at you. It is an extremely welcoming environment and has a feel of family."
My program of elementary education is great! Students are required to have an ACT score of 26+ or take the PPST in order to be accepted. The program is then divided in different blocks that are based on one another. The student takes the classes in each block plus classes from his/her concetration. The program helps students with admittance.
"Safety is a top concern for the university. There are escorts, police officers, and telephone poles that can be reached when feeling unsafe. Although campus is supervised well, there are some areas that are not well lit and might be scary to walk alone. I would advise that no one ever walk alone on campus during night. Many safety services are provided by the university to help students keep safe."
"Kansas has crazy weather. Rain and snow are the craziest. It is smart to consider this type of weather when driving and walking to class. For example, rain boots and an umbrella are a big must when its pouring outside! Weather can also be very humid during the summer! It is important to understand how to adjust to the weather changes."
"The cost can be a little much on campus; however, living on campus has many benefits. Students get to meet new people and become somewhat more involved. Living on campus is also an easier way to get to class on time. The dorms always have activities for their residents and take great care of their safety."
"Drugs are not commonly seen around campus. Alcohol is common outside of the university area. All students take an alcohol course (freshman) to become aware of alcohol usage. The substance policy is very strict and well set out at k-state. Students and staff respect and understand the importance of the policy. Peer pressure can be common, but choices need to be made wisely."
beautiful spring and fall but rough and cold winters
"great greek life, plenty of diversity in chapters."
"When I first went to k-state I a lot of financial aid, but now with the economy it's not as much as I wished. I would recommend to start filling out scholarships as soon as you can. And as many as you can."
"The weather in Kansas is really odd. When it's really bad, classes well be canceled. It can get really cold and treacherous walking to class when it snows."
"There is not hard core drug scene really. There is alcohol, but that is at parties. They require every incoming freshman to take an alcohol U course."
"Manhattan is a true college town. There are many activities to do around town. It's a beautiful town, very safe and homey. The locals love the college kids."
Football: sold out?!? Love the spirit from students and alumni for all the sports!
They don't seem to give out very many scholarships despite having good act scores and GPA's in high school. I know a few very smart and talented people who intended on going to Kansas State but went elsewhere because they received much more financial assistance from other universities
"Greek life at K-State is wonderful! I wasn't sure at first about even joining a sorority because of the steriotypes associated but it's not bad at K-State. I have had a great time creating friendships and memories that will last me a lifetime. No, Greek Life isn't for everyone but I encourage going through Rush and giving it a try. Especially if you're attending K-State."
"There are places to eat off-campus, but it's more economical to have a meal plan and eat university food. The Pita Pit in Aggieville has excellent gyros."
"Great. There is a wide variety of people here, a group for everyone to join. There are musicians, equestrians, ag background, journalists... a niche for anyone. And everyone seems to get a long, as far as I can see. The dorms are friendly."
"Our campus is very accessible and the (Free!) tutoring is great. The people there are serious about studying and academics, so it's easy to find a study partner. However, they also know how to have fun. The study abroad office is super helpful. Everyone I have talked to needing to get something done has been very competent."
"Amazing. The architecture is beautiful, the campus is clean, and the people are friendly. It's like Hogwarts."
"There are plenty of places to hang out at night, and plenty of university or club sponsored late night activities. Aggieville is down the road for those who are over 21... but I prefer staying on campus and hanging out with friends, or taking a car to a late night movie or Sonic run with my buddies."
You can join their group even if you are not related
"There is an awesome nightlife for all ages. Aggieville is an awesome place to go but if you are not of age there is still other things to do. For example, house parties, fraternities, etc."
All the off-campus housing is pretty nice. You can find a lot of housing near campus and aggieville.
I wouldn't say drugs is a huge issue. People do them but it doesn't really effect those who choose not to.
"Weather is usually not an issue. However, once winter rolls around snow can become a problem when getting to and from class."
"You can get everywhere on campus by walking but there are other options as well. You can take the bus, etc."
"Religion is very well respected at K-state. Different organizationns/clubs are made available for the different backgrounds. At K-state, there are many different religions and ethnicities. Different clubs and organizations are also provided for the different ethnicities. All religious and ethnicties make up a great part of K-state and its' social life. Economic backgrounds are also supported at K-state. Students help students who need financial assistance. Sexual orientation is also well respected at K-state. Overall, all differences are well accepted and welcomed at KSU . A student will often find a place where he/she is welcomed by people with the same interests."
"K-state has a variety of computers that are available for students. Macs and PC are available. However, many students tend to go to the labs available, and the computers fill up quickly. Printing is available at all computer areas, and might consist of a charge. For most departments, a lab is provided where students can do homework or complete coursework. Wireless access on campus is great. Signal can be found in most areas. A handful of students do carry their laptops to class or for homework. Laptops are convenient because signal is always available. Laptops, however, are not a complete necessity on campus--unless told by instructor. For the most part, K-state does a good job at meeting the technological needs for students."
"K-state has very limited parking. People will roam the parking lot for hours in order to get a great parking spot. From experience, the parking lot has more availability when classes are early (such as 8 am). I believe that students should leave for class at least 30 minutes before in order to find a parking spot and make it to class. At times, parking can be blocks away and more time is needed."
"Greek life is a huge part of K-state. Frats and sororities make up many activities that involve all students on campus. From my experience, sororities and frats do not treat anybody differently depending on whether they are Greek or not. I believe that at K-state, these organizations are well respected and looked upon. I am not part of a Greek organization, but am proud of the motivation that they bring to all students on campus."
"Aggievile is the best! All you need you can find there, or the mall right down the street!"
"Though there is not a public bus, there are shuttles that help students get around the town. Since Manhattan is not that big of a town, it works out pretty well."
"The off campus housing is very nice and convenient when it comes to k-state, even though it can get a little pricey in comparison to other areas of Kansas."
"The greek life at ksu isn't viewed very well by students that aren't involved in it, but this is most likely due to the pompous attitude many fraternity members have toward other students."
"The health and safety at K-State is awesome. The only problem you might run into is drunk students on a weekend, but other than that a student has nothing to worry about."
"There is such a good variety of parties that you can pretty much pick whatever you're feeling. Plus, Aggieville of course"
"There are a lot of amazing local places, plus a good variety of national chains. The only thing is that since MHK is not exactly a big town, they don't stay open too late"
"I've only been involved in Greek life for a semester, but so far it's been a blast and I've made so many friends"
"Kansas weather varies quite a bit. We have both extremes, which caters to everyone!"
"The Derby Dining center is AMAZING. Students are provide with many meal options ranging from, Chinese, Italian, and Deli, plus many more. They cook an awesome Thanksgiving Dinner. There is a fully stocked salad bar with many healthy options. Also with Kansas State being an agriculture school, we are provided with fresh dairy and meat. Call Hall ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever tasted. Purple Pride is my favorite flavor. There is also a bakery located in the Derb. The make the best 'smores rice crispys."
"Off-campus dining in Manhattan is awesome. There are so many convenient locations. We have Aggieville which is just 5 minutes from the dorms. It's full of restaurants with affordable menus. In Aggieville there are many bars and grills that offer great discounts. We are also given many coupon books, that have excellent deals."
I feel for the most part that Kansas State University's campus is safe. There are panic buttons set up around campus. I do wish though that there were more overhead lights on campus. Don't leave your belongings just laying around in the library or for that matter anywhere. They are pretty strict on who is let into the dorms. After a certain time they check I.D.s in the dorms. Also at certain dorm entrances you have to swipe a valid KSU I.D.
"Manhattan is a college town. The whole thing is built around the school, and there is very good atmosphere overall. The town and college community work together to make Manhattan a great place to grow, work, study, and live!"
"There is pretty much always stuff going on, wheather its held by the school or just random things around town. You'll never be board."
"There are so many options in manhattan! Aggie ville is the place to be, especially if your 21+!! Still, if you arent 21 aggie ville is still awesome."
"Unfortunetaly, i didnt recieve any scholarships at all. i had a 3.8 gpa in high school and thought i might be able to get a small scholarship, but even that didnt happen. Luckily i am in the military and they help pay for school. I had a financial emergency though and need a student loan, that process took a month to get through, but they waived all my late fees."
"It is really nice to have options on campus. If you want to study, hale library is great. Hungry? theres always the union. Needing a wake me up? they have multiple coffee shops throughout campus.
Coming in during spring semester is a bit harder to make friends. So if your looking to find a ton of friends, start in the fall."
"There a plenty of options at the union, and to make things even better, they will be expanding it to make room for more people."
"Hale library offers both macs and pc. So that if you are a loyal fan of either, you can use the one you prefer."
"If you know some friends or are really cool with your roommates, it can be a lot of fun. Manhattan is a really cool place to live on your own."
"Parking is pretty bad in ksu. Try not to use a car as much, bikes are better transportation in this college."
I didn't receive financial aid at my school. The only offer was loans which I didn't want to take.
Police are strict when it comes to following the rules of the road on campus but I'm not sure on anything else.
"Most apartments around k-state are around the $500 range per person a month. Some come furnished, some not. Some complexes do lease specials so watch for them online. They are located fairly close to campus. Most students live within two miles from campus; which is about a 45 minute walk."
"The girls here seem really cliquey like they are still in high school. You can tell the sorority girls and regular girls apart easily, too. The guys here are really chill and seem pretty friendly."
Right now the student Union is being renovated because it is the central part of campus everyone visits.
It is windy in this part of kansas. The days when it isn't is a blessing. Also some days the feedlot smells travel to campus and it knocks you out.
There are many people with different religions and backgrouds at KSU and compared to how I was raised it is a drastic change from my small Kansas town.
"There is plenty of off-campus housing, but everything here is very expensive."
"We live in Kansas, so the weather here changes all the time. One minute its hot and humid, the next minute there's a tornado. I've lived in Kansas all my life so I'm used to it. But for anyone moving from another state, be prepared for all types of weather."
KSU is very seriously about their health and safety of students. They take every precaution to make sure there arent any diseases passed around and that they keep there students as safe as possible.
"My major is Accounting and since the Business school at KSU is one of the top in the state, I can say that it isn't the easiest but it will be worth it in the long run."
I came to KSU as a transfer student. I have not spent much time at KSU but so far I like it. It is a very big campus and sometimes classes are hard to find but it gets better when you start to get more comfortable with it.
Professors are always available to meet with you about academics or other things; advisors are always available to accommodate your academic needs as well.
"The professors really just want the best for you; they ensure academic honesty (no cheating), and are very adamant about attendance, to make sure you know the criteria you need for your graduation. The police are always on the people's side, so it is very safe here."
"The grounds at K-State are one of a kind. The library is huge and new, with lots of modern amenities. The football stadium just got renovated as well as the rec center. The new basketball stadium is beautiful! There are tons of study/hangout spots on campus. Lots of activities such as movies on the lawn, art galleries, and concerts. Lots of fun campus traditions as well!"
"Public transportation is not a necessity for most students. You can get from one end of campus to the other in ten minutes, walking. But they do offer public transportation and there are many different drop off and pick up points and they have lots of buses so you never have to wait long."
Campus life is amazing! I met so many people and I didn't know anyone before attending! K-State does an amazing job of getting students involved. I was able to easily land an awesome on-campus job in the office of admissions which I love! All the buildings are well taken care of and you can walk the entire campus which is very nice instead of having to drive or bike to all of your classes. The grounds are absolutely beautiful as well.
"Although it is not too difficult to get into the business program, it is important to maintain a good gpa and to take the correct classes to stay in the program. The counselors are very helpful in assuring you are taking the appropriate courses."
"I really like being involved in the business program because there are so many different way to get involved in everything the program has to offer. There are always seminars, guest speakers, and lectures going on to help better everyone in the program."
This program is very helpful because the material is superior and all the professors are interested in helping their students learn properly and succeed.
"I have never felt unsafe on campus; during the day, and at night. However I have heard stories about girls walking through campus at night, alone, from Aggie and getting hurt, but just be smart and walk with a friends and keep your cellphone in hand. Campus police are always driving around 24/7 too."
"Coming from a big city, I think the diversity here is decent. The population is mostly white, but you CAN make friends of other race and background if you just put yourself out there and are open to different thoughts and opinions. I've made friends from China, Brazil, and Iraq in a semester. Most of them were scared/nervous to confront me and then to talk to me because of English speaking insecurities."
"Just like high school, Football, Volleyball and Basketball are king. However, I never used to really like watch any of these until coming to K-state. I honestly wouldn't miss a football game ever again, and have learned a great deal about each sport!"
"Drugs are around, and kids will get them no matter what. K-state does a good job when you first come to school giving you a crash course on drug and alcohol safety though."
"Parking services is absolutely terrible. Ridiculous rules, outrageous fines. Absolutely no jurisdiction or public services."
"I have always felt safe on KSU ground, although I do have some fear of walking alone at night, considering I am a female. I would suggest to any college female to walk with at least one other person, because there are sick people out here. Campus Security is always riding through checking parking lots, and securing the campus the best they can. If there is a problem on campus, they are sure to attend to that problem immediately."
"Manhattan, Kansas is a relatively small town. It is not a lot of things to do for entertainment, besides being on campus. The closest mall is in walking distance but there could be some improvements and there are very few restaurants. Owning a car in Manhattan is a must because it is almost impossible to find fun things to without traveling a distance. Aggieville, a popular attraction in walking distance of the campus, is for students 21 and over. There is absolutely NOTHING in Aggieville to do if you are under 21 besides eat at Chipotle and a few other restaurants. It is very overrated and there should be more for minors to engage in."
"Although KSU speaks a lot about how 'diverse' the college seems to be, I have now attended KSU for a year and it is not diverse by any means. 80% are white and the other 20% is African-American, Asian, etc. Sometimes it is difficult for African Americans to fit in with the majority because there is a feeling that we do not belong, or we are not part of the KSU family. KSU does a wonderful job of talking about diversity, but I feel as if not of action has taken place."
"I enjoy being in my program. The instructors that teach in the art department are very easy to get along with. They are also very helpful if you have any problems just let them know in a timely manner and they are usually willing to help. If you manger your time right then the work load is not so bad, just don't fall behind."
I give an A for the school not being so strict. The only thing that I really know is that if your trying to advertise something on campus you have to have permission to hang up a flier.
"I havent had an internship on campus but I had an internship back in my home town. I really enjoyed it, I got to meet new people and I gain more knowledge. Fine Arts major does require a lot of time commitment, there have been plenty of times where I've been up all night completing a project. It can be a little expensive purchasing all of the art supplies required."
"Getting into the school was easy and getting into the Fine Arts program wasn't as challenging, it was specializing in a field that was a little challenging. In order to get into the area of field you have to display works from other classes showing that your work is good and fits the area you chose. The professors decide if your work is good or not and this determines if your in or not."
I never feel unsafe unless its super late at night.
Architecture at KSU is phenomenal but there is little time for a job on the side and the extra expenses are high.
You will walk everywhere but nothing is terribly far. There is safe ride (a bussing system to utilize as designated drivers).
The architecture program is phenomenal. I couldn't have picked a better school for my lifestyle and major.
sometimes a little crowded - good food as far as cafeterias go
"great range of majors, helpful professors, progressive curriculum"
"The school spirit at K-State is contagious! From football to equestrian, there is overflowing support and love for anyone involved in a sport. All teams get the acknowledgement they deserve and we all become part of the K-State family. You'll be yelling EMAW! before the first day of classes!!"
"The guys at K-State are all fairly nice, and there a lot of cute ones if you know where to look! Don't get scared of the ""Ag school"" stigma! There are plenty of people on campus who have nothing to do with agriculture. You will for sure find someone who you get along with!"
"Decent housing, mostly older houses but considering it's mostly students living near campus it's adequate"
Places around campus are pretty good but. Decent variety but there could always be more. All are easily accessible though.
Drugs are not huge but as most cases it depends on the group you hang out with
"You can buy a parking permit at the beginning of the school year or whenever you get your car. Whatever parking permit you have depends on where you can park. Most of the parking lots close to the building on campus are T lot and cost more. The main parking lot for the students in the residence halls fills up quickly and then the back lots fill up too. You can get a ticket on any day during the week and on the weekend during the day time. After night falls on the weekend, you can park wherever without having to worry about getting a ticket."
The school has some good ideas. They promote staying off drugs.
"Basically you have to either have your own vehicle or a bicycle.. thats the most common and it seems to be a good way to get around, but there isnt any bus systems that i know of."
"I received a decent amount of financial aid, but not that many scholarships. It was very easy to get financial aid and it was easy to get and apply for scholarships."
"I came to Kansas State because of the architecture program. The professors I have had have been mostly great (some not so great, but that's everywhere). They are always available to answer questions, and encourage you to do well in their classes by making time for you after class."
"Nightlife at Aggieville is for students 21 and older. The best bet are fraternity parties and house parties. They're free and the music is good and you can usually find a driver, or it's close enough to walk back to campus."
K-State's sports are important to everyone on campus and huge. The students and faculty alike are always sporting purple and white because everyone who goes here is proud of our sports! The workout facilities have just been renovated and are wonderful. We also have a lot of popular IM sports which everyone from Fraternities to dorm complex's compete in.
I have always felt safe on K-State's campus. Whenever you're out at night you always see police patrolling and there are blue lights all around campus in case you get into any trouble.
"Permits are expensive. They give out way more permits than parking spots so there is no guarantee that you will get one close to your class. The good thing about being in agriculture, is that there is typically lots of open spaces to park because most of the people go to class on the other side of campus."
There is always housing available. Some are very expensive depending on how close to campus or the football stadium. Some are just dumps. The landlords do the bare minimum. Some rental companies are very good. They leave you alone and are usually willing to fix most things that break due to old age.
"No alcohol or drugs on campus, no smoking within so many feet of the buildings. Rules are rules, they all get broken. The school has rules, students choose whether to follow them or not. If students can't keep up thier grades then they get put on academic probabation or get kicked out."
"I feel fairly safe on campus. I try not to waste too much time on campus at night because there are a lot of buildings, trees, and shrubs that could be potential hiding spots for those with terrible intentions. Crime happens. How much is actually reported or at least reported to the public is a mystery."
"There are some Greek houses that are not good, but there are some that are excellent! Such as Kappa Kappa Gamma and Farmhouse."
It's not super visible and enforcement is evident. There are situations that do take place and improvement can always be there...
I am in the Architecture program and it is one of the best in the country. The teachers are incredible.
"Athletics are a huge thing, everyone gets really excited for games."
"I always feel safe walking around campus, even late at night. The blue lights make it very easy to reach someone if you feel unsafe."
They have safe ride if you're intoxicated. It's all free.
"Usually, they do not bother you unless someone calls them, but once they are there, they enforce the rules very well."
Wonderful place. Everyone is exciting and fun. Work for classes is not overbearing.
"The housing process is easily explained and there are always people willing to help out. West Hall was full of people that love to talk, partake is safe ways to have fun, and are always greeting people with a smile. Our elevators didn't always work, but the friendliness of the people completely made up for it! I felt like I was legitimately at home."
"I am majoring in Construction Science and Management at Kansas State University. So far the advisors and teachers in this college have been very very helpful to me. They have an open door policy so if their office door is open you are welcome to come in and talk to them about anything you have questions about. Classrooms in my building have been updated in the past 5 years and provide a very nice area to learn in. When it come to job placement or finding an internship, the college of engineering does a great job at making sure you have every possibility in finding the company that works for you."
I came to Kansas State because both of my parents attended K-State so the choice of where to go for college was an easy one for me. The teachers and advisors in the college of engineering have been really great. They are very passionate about the area of study and are willing to help students out whenever they need it.
Drugs at Kansas State are not too big of a problem. Drinking would be the biggest and most popular activity that students go with on the weekends. Drinking in the resident halls is monitored on a night to night basis and dealt with when it is necessary.
"Varsity athletics are a big part of the student experience at Kansas State University. In the 2012-2013 academic year the sports at K-State have won a conference championship in football, basketball, and baseball. We have also had great success in many other varsity sports. The university has decided to add state of the art train facilities for basketball and football that will improve both the fan experience and athletes experience. All major sports at K-State are backed by a large group of very faithful fans. Students and alumni provide a great fan experience that is hard to match."
I have applied for several based on their application questionnaire and never heard a response on anything. They seem to offer a lot but for very obscure things.
I have never experienced a problem with my online classes. IT is always available for help and the connection to my professors is great.
I don't know as I am going to transfer to Kansas State in the fall.
"Kansas State has an awesome program for transfer students. There was a Transfer Student Orientation where we got more information about our program and were able to meet with advisers in our field. I didn't have a separate application for the Kinesiology program, however I will have a separate application when I apply to the Master's program. It was easy to have my transcripts transferred from my community college to Kansas State and they can print out a degree audit report to find out where you need to go and what classes you need to take."
The Kinesiology program and professors have been so helpful as I transfer from Johnson County Community College to Kansas State for the fall 2013. Job placement after completing the Kinesiology program looks promising and I know it will help me in my chosen career field of firefighting.
I came here becasue the department offered me the chance to study exactly what I wanted. The campus so far has been great and all the people are very friendly.
"It was pretty difficult. Being accepted was dependant upon availbale funding in the labs you were interested in working at; however, if funding was available and they were interested in your application it was fairly easy."
"There are plenty computers in the library if you do not own one, also buildings have computer labs. The wifi is great and works well. Every students gets $10 a semester for free printing in the library so thats great!"
"getting into the education program does consist of an entry exam, but from what I have heard it not too bad. You also have to take certain classes before geeting into the program and have at least a 2.5 gpa"
My education major is great and I love it. They offer the perfect program that provides field experience all through out the program.
"I love my major, the education program they offer is great and you get all the right experience."
"Very good selection for a small town, there is a lot of variety."
One day it can be snowing and the next day it will be sunny at 80 degrees. Kansas weather is not good.
The student body at KSU is very diverse. We have an international students center for all out of the country students. Acceptance here is very good.
Many teachers I have had are very strict on the Honor Code. Police are pretty strict on underage drinking and will usually give out tickets if underage kids are caught.
KSU has many academic programs that students can choose from. The advisers are great at helping you move to the next level in your college career. There is always something to do on campus such as jobs or different activities.
Kansas State University's campus is awesome. The newly renovated recreational center is very modern and students love it. The student union could use a little renovation but other than that it is great. There are always activities to do on campus.
"Although a car isn't needed, if you have one you can get around quickly with no traffic problems. Additionally, public transportation is convenient and you can easily get to and from campus."
It's pretty expensive and the way in which it is organized and distributed is somewhat puzzling.
"There are always computers open for use on campus and they are located all over the place. This includes the libraries, residence halls, dining centers, and several other locations."
Don't have a car so I don't know too much about it but it all depends on the parking pass you signed up for.
The dorms are a great place to live. I myself am I freshman but love the floor I am on. Not to mention that I live closer to the engineering building which accommodates my major.
"Everyone at K-state is very friendly. It is a campus where you can get along, or get help from almost anyone you need to."
"I would choose my major again in a heartbeat! I want to be a school psychologist eventually, and at first I was a psychology major but after visiting I was told that the psychology department here was more science based and family studies is more of the personal side of it and since that is what I want to do I switched. I have not regretted my choice since then."
I absolutely love my major! Every class I have had covers real life material that I can use in every aspect of my life.
"I am a Family Studies and Human Services major and I declared my major before enrolling at K-State and it was a super easy process. I was accepted to the university as a Psychology major and changed to Family Studies and Human Services the day of enrollment and it was as easy as changing it on the computer, no special application required"
"Manhattan is a great place to be! Our older community interacts very well with college students and college students interact with everyone else in the community. I volunteer at Hand to Hand which is a place to tutor at risk 3 days a week. There are students, classes, and groups who visit nursing homes as well as assisted living. We have an on sight daycare center for students with children as well as faculty with children. Our education department works hand in hand with that facility. We have a beautiful downtown with many fun small town local shops as well as a mall."
"Our off campus housing is large. There are houses, condos, apartments, duplexes, and so much more surrounding the university. There are a few rental companies that provide housing but they all seem to be pretty nice. I am living in a house next year off of Thurston street and my landlord is the sweetest lady. Her husband is a local dentist and very understanding. Most houses are independently owned rather than apartments that are owned by a company."
Kansas State University has beautiful landscaping and we just passed the vote to increase the amount of trees on campus and plant several more over the summer months. We have been told that buildings resemble hogwarts in the way they are built and how they look. They have limestone blocks on the outside with great colors and usable space on the inside. Our Greek system plays a large role in our campus life as do many other on campus groups. We have a very strong and vocal student body. We are a family here at K-State!
"Our athletic centers are for the most part brand new and have been taken very good care of. We are currently rebuilding the alumni side of our football stadium, the basketball complex was completed this last fall, the rowing team is just starting the building of their new facility. We have just completed the renovation of the rec complex and it now has a roller hockey rink, rock climbing wall, as well as many new cool features. Our library looks like a building off of harry potter as do the rest of our buildings on campus. Our library is 5 stories and huge!! There are quiet floors meant for studying as well as cubies for holding group meetings. The vote was just past for the new renovation of our student union. Our leadership studies building is a green building and the first on our campus. It has made such a huge impact on our student body and our responsibility to the environment. We are also under the planning part of building a new Business building. Kansas State is suppose to be in the top 25 business schools in the nation by 2025! The building plans are underway!"
I am a Kappa Delta at Kansas State and our Greek system is wonderful. There are 12 about to be 13 sororities and 25 fraternities. There are also 9 multicultural houses and 6 non traditional sororities and fraternities. We have a very close nit community and a sense of family here at K-State.
"Kansas State has 3 dining halls for the dorms. The Derby complex which is the largest and has the most options, Kramer, and Van Zile. Derby dining hall is connected to the 4 largest dorms West, Ford, Haymaker, and Moore. There are underground tunnels that lead to the complex. The dining center has the classics line which is a different meal everyday for example fried chicken mashed potatoes and green beans. It is a full meal that is homey. There is a taco bar which has taco and nacho fixings, a sub bar where you can have your own sandwich with your choice of bread, meat, cheese, and fixings, there is a hamburger and french fries bar as well, and an willie wok which has oriental food for our exchange students and anyone else wanting something different."
I gave the food a solid A because the majority of it is very good and tasty. But on some days I think the chef wants to experiment and serve something weird or the food might be leftovers from the previous day.
I graded it with a B+ because the campus shuttles only run during food serving times. So throughout the rest of the ay you have to walk everywhere.
You can apply but the most scholarships are out there for freshman
"Frats, house parties, bars, they are all ou there. Fake Patties and football season."
"Parking Services is TOUGH. Hours are kind of weird and streets, allies, etc are always packed. Parking passes are EXPENSIVE."
"Kansas weather is extremely unpredictable. It snowed a few days ago and the high for tomorrow is sixty-eight degrees. Although the weather gets pretty crazy, classes are rarely cancelled. It is just easy to get sick and become annoyed with walking to class through rain, snow, ice, and sunshine all in one week."
"I am an elementary education major at Kansas State University and I love it thus far. The workload is manageable and leaves time for oneself. Despite the general education classes required, the professional program classes are very thorough and easy to understand. The advisors in the college of education make it easy to form connections to hopefully lead to jobs and internships later. Though the building for the college of education is outdated, the professors and staff make good use of it."
"K-State is a great school! There are so many opportunities offered: study abroad, work study, awesome hang out spots, 24/7 library hours, manageable classes. The professors, staff and administration are personable, reasonable, and flexible. It is easy to talk to them and work with them on homework and tests. Many of the professors also give great advice on personal problems if asked. I love being an elementary education major because the program is amazing and all my professors are easily reached."
It is very easy to get financial aid at K-State. They send you lots of e-mails to remind you when you need to view or update your account information. They also send e-mails for when you should fill out your FASFA and when your aid is ready to view. I have zero complaints about financial aid.
"If you have fairly good grades and demonstrate that you try in school you will get at least one scholarship. They want you to come to K-State and they WILL help you, but you have to show them that you are a good investment!"
"Passes are $180 and sometimes you have to park pretty far away. However, you can always get a spot. And you wont have to walk as far as you would if you went to KU (by a looooong shot)."
"K-State isn't just a college - it's a family. Everyone (professors, advisors, other students) strives to help you to do well in school. ""The Rec"" offers free work out class and a bomb rock wall. Aggieville is a strip of bars that everyone goes to on the weekend and it rocks. Small town atmosphere in a bigger city with a lot of amenities."
My program is fairly diverse. Part of it is outdated and needs to be improved but is overall a good program.
Manhattan is amazing. It has a small town feel wrapped in a big city.
"My school is fairly relaxed for many things, but they crack down when they need to."
Campus is diverse and very accepting of new styles.
"Our campus is small, so getting from class to class is easy and no transport is needed. We have a safe ride for nights and it is free. If you need a ride anywhere back to campus you can call and they are helpful and come whenever you need them."
"Average. There is plenty of housing close enough to campus, but parking and cost is an issue."
Get a parking Pass for the parking garage by the Student Union and you will always have a parking spot for classes. It costs only $65 per semester.
"The recreation facility has added an addition and it is awesome! There is an indoor hockey ring, used for soccer, volley ball, and basketball as well. The expansion brings a euphoric feeling every time I enter."
"Last year, the university blown up the football stadium and currently building the expansion, which looks great."
I eat in the Derby Dining Center as Ksu and it is really good quality food. They have all sorts of options and serves as an all you can eat buffet.
"Athletics are extremely important to K-state, and everyone treats them like royalty. You even find a lot of people scared to approach them and start any sort of conversation. IM sports are so much fun, especially with how many teams we get to compete. They really challenge you athletically."
"Extremely inconsistent and often freezing temperatures. It can be 75 and sunny one day, but then 33 the next. Class rarely gets cancelled and we have pretty bad street clean-up teams."
On the main campus the athletic life is great and everyone loves there wildcats. Salina has still a big following of the wildcats pride. IM are big at both campuses and a great way to stay active in a hectic lifestyle
I rarely ever see drugs on the campus. Outside of the campus it is not a great city so drugs are an abundant source. Drinking is little although some students partake in it
"Its extremly windy, in the winter its cold and in april it is hot one day and cold the next which is very frustrating. In the summer time the heat is almost unbearable too"
"Process was very easy, and the advisors are very helpful with getting you on track with all the requirements"
"Being an education major, it is very important to be able to have the opportunities to learn face to face with other teachers, and get that hands on experience"
Its going to be very difficult and Technical. Civil Engineering is a Math and science ruled program. If you don't like math or find it stressful don't declare a engineering major. The workload and curriculum is okay seeing that i'm only a freshman and will get harder. Jobs and internships are there you just have to work for them.
It was a pretty simple process to get into my major/ program. There aren't that many requirements for CE major. it really often depend on what the school is known for and what there best programs are. Then comes the special processes and things.
I do plan to have one. Kansas state does really well with students and helping them find jobs and other thing. I feel like internships are the easiest way to get your name in the business world along with lots of things.
Kansas Has a pretty nice policy on alcohol and drugs they have a online Alcohol Education program they all freshmen are required to complete and it has lots of useful information too on how to handle the situations . You can't really stop anyone from doing what they please. Its definitely frowned upon by staff and some students.
"I'm a Civil Engineering Major, I don't know what made me choose that but its definitely going to be changed. I hate Math. But, this school has an out standing Engineering faculty as well as Course requirements. Like for example i have to attend assemblies about CE which helps students figure out whether they want to actually become a Civil Engineer or not. There's a huge faculty willing to help any student no matter what type of engineering major they have; its just a all around wonderful program."
"The upside is that the close proximity of Aggieville, with shops and restaurants. the airport has good connections for such a relatively small community. Local public transportation is inadequate, but is being worked on."
Excellent academic environment. I have attended an AAU university and the professors and curriculum were as good or better than the other university. Very friendly environment that does not have as much of a competitive feel.
Kansas State University has a strong liberal arts faculty for being a state university.
"K-state is an amazing place to go to school. I have only one complaint, February in Kansas is the worst."
"Public transportation seems fairly new to the town. They still have a lot of hiccups and flaws in the system. For one there buses don't run every thirty minutes to an hour and I spend a lot of time waiting for them to show up at the stops. The buses are also very crowded and small, especially in the morning when students are trying to catch a ride to class. Seating is also very limited, and often times some drivers will allow people to stand in the back or in the walkway, and some drivers won't allow anyone to stand at all if buses are full. Also, I've experienced bus drivers that were ""full"" (all the seats were taken and no one was standing), but the bus driver kept driving around to her stops and would stop and tell the students that were waiting to get on that she was full. Some of these drivers should not be drivers because of this lack of common sense. If the bus is full, drop off the students instead of driving around telling people you are full."
"The college requires an Alcohol Edu. online class for each student and it also has random follow up quizzes and videos that must be completed within a given time period. The drug scene on campus I'm not really aware of considering I live off campus. The scene outside, however, is about average. Drinking and going out is most commonly observed between Thursday and Saturday. There are smokers too. Obviously if you don't hang out with a group of people that smoke or drink it won't be an issue to stay clear of it."
The parking is very limited on campus... very. If you want to find a parking spot you must be there 30 minutes to an hour early. A good/better solution is to park a few blocks away from campus and walk to class that way. Also talk to friends and see how they get to campus. I personally take the ATA busses and it is pretty dependable if you can make the bus stops on time.
"The dorms are nice. Strong complex is much smaller than Kramer and Derby, but Derby and Strong are right across the ""street"" from each other. Kramer is near the engineering buildings. The food is good, there's laundry in the basements, and a Quik Cats in each complex. Strong and Derby also have tunnels connecting the dorms to the dining center. Kramer does not, but their really close anyway."
"Manhattan is a great town. It's not huge, but there is generally something to do. It's definitely a college town, so virtually everyone is accepting of students."
"The food is pretty good, with lots of different varieties of food to choose from."
"I am in the College of Psychology and it has been challenging so far. I came in as a transfer student, so I am getting all my core classes at once which can be a large load. But I am enjoying it. The college has several activities for the major and many research opportunities if you are interested."
There are plenty of computers throughout the campus. You can also borrow laptops from the library. Theres usually no trouble trying to find a computer.
"My freshman year, I received a scholarship that basically covered half of tuition for each semester, and I had a couple other scholarships as well. It's a partial renewable scholarship, so that means that I need to keep my GPA up to receive it, which I think most renewable scholarships work that way. If you get a higher ACT or SAT score, the more scholarship money you receive. If you are need-based financial aid, you might get some, or work study, or something. I was not considered ""need-based"". From K-State, I've only received the one. I don't know how it is for transfer students, either."
"There are so many majors to choose from, I think the information packet they send out says over 250? I'm a music education major, and I love it! Not sure how other departments handle advisors, but there is one advisor for all the music ed majors, and he knows what he's doing! They have quite a few minors as well. I know the architecture program is good, and engineering and agriculture as well. After my first year here, I think K-State is doing well!"
"I don't know the right way to grade the weather! It's Kansas, and the weather can vary significantly, even within a week (snow one day, then 60 degrees a few days later). However, the weather can be beautiful. While here, you pretty much get every season."
My first major was Landscape Architecture. It is currently ranked #3 among colleges in the US. It is a very tough program to get into. The upside though is that the professors are very intelligent and helpful. Many options can be opened up in this major and the rest of the CAPD.
"Greek life on campus has a very large population. There are definitely different mixed feelings between Greek and non-Greek. Many are very friendly, but others can act very stuck up if you aren't a part of the Greek system. I have many good friends who are Greek. Just depends on the people you meeting. Also there are a lot of different houses on campus so you will probably fit into some if you are thinking about going Greek."
"Kansas weather keeps you guessing. We can have 80 degrees on Monday and snowing by Thursday. The school is pretty good about clearing the sidewalks, although the edges of campus can be icy."
"There are lots of safety programs on campus, such as SafeRide and Wildcat walk. Campus is also well-lit at night, although it never hurts to be careful. I avoid walking by myself at night on principle."
"Almost all of the proffesors are great, especially in the K-State's College of Ag. I have had a one or two classes with instructors who had heavy accents that were hard to understand."
Kansas State is a big enough school that you can find just about every sort of guy or girl. You just have to know what part of campus to look.
"KSU is great for small town students looking to feel comfortable. But it isn't a happening city, at all. It's a very pleasant place to live, everyone has that bit of midwestern charm, not to mention the ever wonderful cowboys that go to school here! But if you're looking for more than drinking cheep beer and mudding in a truck or drinking in one of the handful of bars in our downtown area, KSU isn't the school for you."
"KSU is a great, safe campus. I've been out on campus on weekends, late, LATE at night, and on breaks, and no matter what I've never felt threatned or unsafe. Off campus on the weekends, sometimes it gets a bit rowdy, as expected. But the police patrol regularly, and even have a program called ""Wildcat Walk"" where you can call to have someone escort you up to I believe a mile plus off campus if you don't feel safe leaving somewhere on campus. Even though I'm not sure it's needed much at all, KSU has great security measures."
"I recieved a decent amount of finacial aid, basic things like ACT scores decide which basic scholarships you get from the university. Just make sure you apply by the deadline, and spend any time you can applying for scholarships not directly associated to the university. Explore your options, it'll pay off@"
"Architecture is very exhausting, but is well worth it for a master in 5 years. If you see yourself doing it, why not work on it to the fullest for a better future?"
"The architecture program has great counselors who work very well with you to schedule your classes at each semester. The professors I have had are a bit wishy-washy with their grading, sometimes being too lenient on people and harsh on others. The libraries are great places to study tho"
Things are fairly close together and have good movement between even during busier hours
"The KSU union is a great place to get some food and hang out with friends. A lot of meetings for extra curricular activities are held there. It is not really a place to study, but there are auditoriums and rooms that are big enough for entertainment. Outside of the union is Bosco Plaza where a lot of fun activities happen. The union is very modern!"
"Drugs and alcohol are not an essential part of Kansas State University. Yes there is alcohol at parties but really we are not known as a ""party"" school. Also on campus the majority or smokers are foreign."
"Nightlife is fun. It's a lot more fun if you're either in a house, or 21 and older though. House parties are a lot of fun too. Going to parties is a fun way to meet people too."
"K-state makes it really easy to get involved with a variety of clubs! There is always something going on in the union, the dorms, or your academic department. Students often get messages across to other students by using chalk on the sidewalks."
"Weather in Kansas is flip-floppy. The university hardly ever cancels for snow days, but when it gets to be nice out I wouldn't want to be any place else."
"It is still an ongoing process for me. I am in the military, and I often get the run around when going in to try and deal with tuition assistance or anything like that. Staying on top of the process in important."
I really like the sense of community Kansas State University has to offer.
"What frustrates me is that some of the lots are very small for parking and yet there is an open field they could expand to. People keep parking in unauthorized areas because they don't want to walk a long distance. It depends on what time you go to class but the moment you pull out or walk to your car, someone is following you. They want the parking space."
"The smaller campus is growing slowly, but its adding more classes and majors as it goes along. I haven't had an internship yet because I am just getting into my finance classes. I will be looking into one as I get closer to graduation. I need to work to support myself in my own home. The campus is mostly guys since its a computer tech and aviation school before the social work and finance classes started."
"Kansas State Salina is out in an open area, the runway for the aircraft does not give a break in the wind. What is nice is they have a hallway linking the building so I don't have to go outside much."
"I go to the smaller Salina campus, the walk is not far from the building and most people keep to themselves."
The campus is very safe. They have buttons all across campus that you can hit if you need help or need someone to walk you to your late classes. All the dorm doors lock every time the shut and you have to use your ID to get in. Your ID only works for YOUR dorm. There are police EVERYWHERE! I feel extremely safe here at K-state!
"This campus is so incredibly beautiful. The buildings are so antique, the green space are big and during the nicer weather you see tons of students laying in the grass doing there homework or just socializing. There are always campus events going on and they are all very welcoming and fun, for the most part."
"For the most part K-State has an excellent network reliability. The speed is very impecable also, especially with having 25,000 students here. I don't use the computers here on campus at all so I stick to my laptop and it has been excellent!"
"A majority of our facilites here at K-State are pretty old. The desk's that I use in my Expos class are the most creaky, wobbly, and distracting things ever. They are written all over and engraved in. Although that is very annoying I am giving K-State a B because I do enjoy the history and the unique beauty in the older buildings here."
I love how during our finals week all the dorms have 24 hour quiet hours except for a few hours in the middle of the day. This gives everyone the perfect opportunity to really concentrate on the finals that they have coming up. They inforce this rule very much and it is greatly appreciated by the ones who study during this time.
I do plan on getting an internship in the future and it is helpful that I get emails for the Psychology department on what is coming up in the internship area.
The process of getting into the Psychology major was easy and continues to be easy. The adviser for the major is helpful in stirring you into the direction that you want to go. They are helpful in emailing you information in up and coming internships and other activities that will help you in the future.
"K-State is in Manhattan, Kansas also known as the little apple. Everything is easy to get to including places off campus."
The landlords in Manhattan are lets just say not the best. If you can find a good landlord you will be fine. Rent is below KC but still not cheap. Expect to pay at a minimum of $300 for just rent per person per month.
Not many things to do off campus. The mall is nice and people are extremely friendly. There are things always happening though and no two nights are the same. During the spring and fall the campus and surrounding areas are overflowing with color and natural beauty
There are so many different ethnicity here. There are many international students and we have an entire building towards the center of campus for international students. Kansas State does a great job at offering scholarships so you can always find money to help pay for tuition. Politics and religion are very different there is no clear party association or religious backgrounds.
"As a Civil Engineer, you are very busy with your math courses. But they are not as hard as you would think. You have to put forth the effort and the desire to become an engineer. You are pretty busy with courses, but you are also able to have a social life. A lot of it depends on how many credit hours you are planning on taking a semester. The professors are really nice, and they want to see you succeed."
"I am very happy with the Civil Engineering program. You have to put forth the effort, but in the end it is very rewarding."
There are a ton of opportunities for off campus housing. They are normally a lot cheaper than living on campus if you get a couple of good guys to live with.
The schools strictness mostly just leans on the professor of the class. Over all the the campus is not very restrictive.
You have a ton of dining options. They give you a great variety of foods to choose from the two main dinning halls.
K-state architecture is one of the best in the U.S. (#5 last time i checked) and its pretty selective admission. The hardest part isnt getting in but staying in. They work you pretty hard to make the less dedicated drop and keep you focused. We started with about 180 people and I think there rare about 100 or so in the 3 major disciplines 2 years later.
Almost entirely alcohol and marijuana. Harder drugs are definitely around just not very out in the open and most people here are pretty conservative and stop at smoking pot if they do anything.
Because they are all fun to go to and we have decent teams for everything.
there are a lot of majors to choose from here at k-state. My currently declared major is Accounting. There are a lot of helpful people in each of the colleges. I am more than satisfied with my education here at my school.
"The weather here in Manhattan is very nice. In the winters we get an average amount of snow, classes are rarely cancelled, although, this year we did get a snow day, in which basically every student went out sledding and exploring."
The students here at k-state are all very friendly. Everyone love to have a good time and we are all a big family.
"I received various scholarships from K-state. some were directly from the school while others were from some of the programs that I'm in. Also my college Dean was of help. She helped finding me some extra money, which really helped a lot"
"I think there is a major for everyone at K-State. The trouble is finding what you like best. I am on my third major now. You really need to find a good advisor, I have had a couple that have not helped at all. You are able to change advisor, so I strongly advise you to do that if it is not working out. Also I wish the advisors were more keen on students studying abroad, they usually act pretty negative toward them."
"There is not a lot of diversity at K-State. We do have many foreign exchange students from Asian countries (China, Japan, India, etc) which helps a little with our diversity problem. I do have to say though that being a Kansas school the majority of our campus is white. I think our campus is very accepting of the different races though, there is no hostility. Everyone is there own person and no one condemns them for that."
"I would highly recommend living in a co-ed dorm for your first year. I lived in Moore and made some really great friends that I am still friends with today even though we don't live together anymore. Moore is community style and that's is what we were, a community. We would do our homework together and go to dinner together in the derb. We started calling each other family too. It may not be that for every floor but if you try to get to know each other it will. Living in the dorms is a great way to make your first friends at K State."
Living on campus as a freshman is a great way to get to know more people. I would recommend it
"The computer science at KSU is actually one of the best in the nation. Except for (literally) 2 professors, each of them is highly involved in research for their perspective field. They not only know what they are talking about, they also know people in the industry."
As long as you actually stay organized the financial aid process is very easy to accomplish. Make sure and do things well ahead of the dead lines.
"I personally don't live off campus, but I have several friends who do. As long as you actually PLAN ahead (6 months) you can get off campus housing that is actually more affordable than on campus (the cost being you need to arrange transportation, or get up earlier)"
"The school is very easy to get around. There is a shuttle service that taeks you between the 3 main dinning halls, There is a shuttle service that goes to Walmart. Near campus is Aggy ville, full of food, books, and parties."
"I didn't receive any financial aid other than student loans this year. The K-State Scholarship application is very specific about what they want their money to go to. I found that the FAFSA was my best option of finding any financial aid but I still took out student loans. My best suggestion would be to look for as many types of financial aid as possible. When deciding what kind of loans to pull out, read up on every type of loan, including private loans. It could be a better option for you."
"Although the population of students is over 20,000 people, K-State feels small compared to most large cities. K-State is largely an agricultural school but has many other things to offer. When it comes to sports, the students provide lots of spirit. We are a family. If you're looking for something to do, you can visit the Sunset Zoo or the Konza Prairie. Or you can visit the Manhattan Town Center Shopping Mall. The Rec Center is completely free to students and so is the Natatorium near the Old Stadium."
"There are many different reliable types of transportation on campus. There are buses that take you from one side of campus to the other frequently throughout the day. If you need a ride on the weekends, catch the Saferide bus. Many things on and off campus are within walking distance so there is no need to bring a car unless it is absolutely needed. All campus-run transportation is free. Public transportation costs are average."
Safety and security on campus is fine. There are never any issues with safety and for the most part everyone is welcoming. Security is always on campus but never in your face. They are prepared but from my knowledge things on campus don’t get out of hand. There are also emergency poles placed all throughout campus. The campus atmosphere is a well matured and a friendly place to be. I always feel safe on campus.
The computers on campus are always ready to be used. There are several places on campus to go if you need to use a computer. Printing on campus is reasonable. Not every place with computers has a printing station but that’s understandable. Speed on the computers is decent. The only trouble I have with speed is when logging in. When it comes to network reliability there have only been a couple computers that seem to have a problem connecting to the network but overall the computers on campus are reliable. Thinking about it the only common problem that occurs is using the campus’ Wi-Fi. What usually happens is connection problems such as finding little connection or none at all. But the computers on campus work pretty well.
I never feel in danger on campus. My dorm has great security features.
Manhattan is has a small town feel for being a pretty decently sized city. It's easy to get around the town and has just about everything you'd need. The people on campus and around the university are always happy and ready to help with anything. It's a great place to be.
The food is varied and generally very well prepared and tastes great.
Theres a lot of variety and great social aspects to the dining areas
"Ther weather here is crazy, but rarely does it affect student life. We learn to live with it."
I have only been to compus once and saw and heard nothing. But i know a few students that do sell and do drugs on campus.
I'm extremely happy with my program. All of the professors really care about what they're doing in the College of Agricluture and I'm never scared to ask for help or go talk to them one on one.
I have an internship this upcoming summer. I will be paid 14.50 an hour and the work weeks will be 40+ hours. I'm not entirely sure what responsibilities I will have yet.
I'm majoring in Agricultural Economics. I really enjoy it since I come from a farming background and it's very easy to relate to what I'm doing in class.
"The campus is always well-lit at night and if you ever feel unsafe at night, you can call and have someone walk with you to where you're going. The shuttles also go around late at night on the weekends, so there are less drunk drivers, which is fantastic."
"Bottom line, Greek life is expensive, there's no way around it. And there are a lot of Greeks at KSU (1 in every 5 students), so Greek life does tend to dominate. You're more likely to have more friends if you're a Greek, but usually most people are pretty friendly, and won't care if you're Greek or not, even if they are. Greek houses also often throw big parties, and everyone is welcome."
"Classes vary from professor to professor, but for the most part, they are designed for you to succeed. There is always somewhere to go for help, with lots of tutoring available, and all the professors are willing to help, if you make an appointment during office hours. However there are quite a few professors in the math and science departments that have foreign accents, and some are really difficult to understand."
"There's a lot of country and small town people here, and you might get made fun of if you're from the city, but nothing serious. The girls can be cliquey if you aren't in their sorority, but mostly people are friendly."
"The architecture is beautiful here. There are lots of older buildings that are unique in appearance, but still in great working condition."
"If you like country boys, KState is the school for you! We are an Ag school, so there are plenty of them. We also have lots of jocks, and frat boys! There are some hotties on our campus."
"The process of getting into the college of business is very easy. All I have to do is fill out a form declaring my major. Everyone is accepted in. So, no worrying about if you got accepted or not."
"I am in the College of Business Administration, and I absolutely love it! All the adviser's are awesome, and they all really know what they are talking about. They send out emails daily with things that we can get involved in, and they really care about your success. Most people that graduate from the College of Business go on to become very successful people."
I feel like the academic policy is very straight forward and enforced well.
"I feel that everyone here is very accepting and I haven't run into any problems about people being ridiculously judgmental. Although racially, not that diverse, but not too bad."
The landlords know that we are college students and can sometimes take advantage of that
"The dorms here at Kansas State University are PHENOMENAL. The ra's get the job done, and they are very clean. Everything about the dorms here are great. Its a very suitable and comfortable living environment. I felt as if i fit right in on the first day. Highly recommended."
"If you came too school here for one day, you would see very little of the same group of people. Here at Kansas State University, everywhere you look you will see a different race of persons. I mean most people here are white, but they arn't the rednecks type of white people, they are the nice caring sweet people. Everyone is accepted here at Kansas State and that is one of the many reasons why I chose this wonderful school."
"Off-campus dining is located throughout the city but is more concentrated towards the east side of town. There are many options to choose from but some of the more visited restaurants are: Applebees, Olive Garden, Old Chicago, Pizza Shuttle (Best Pizza Ever!), and Texas Roadhouse. These are all located on the East side of town which isn't far from the campus. The prices at these locations are reasonable if you're looking for some place nice to eat. There are also places like McDonalds and Taco Bell if you are looking for some place fast to eat."
"The campus law enforcement are pretty strict when it comes to campus policies. They are strict for a reason. 1st time offenders of any narcotics are taken straight to the ""campus court"" and are dealt with right there. At the dorm rooms, 1st time offenders of narcotics is a removal from the premises and a cancelation of their housing contract"
Everyone at Kansas State University is very courteous. They help whenever needed and aren't stuck up.
"If you get there early enough in the morning (i.e. 7:30) parking is a breeze, but after that, you're better off walking or catching the shuttle."
"A little stereotypical, but overall a good program. Expensive though..."
"There are many opportunities, you just have to have the patience to find it. However, if you're under 21, the weekends kind of suck."
"I almost always feel safe on campus. There are plenty of resources that we can use if we don't, like the blue buttons if we're lost or want someone to walk with us."
"You give students all kinds of awareness tools to try and keep themselves safe. This includes alchoaledu, and posters all over campus.The scene itself isn't necessasrily on campus, it's really in the houses and Greek houses around campus. I rarley every see anything in the dorms themselves."
I work in lab as an intern/undergrad research assistant. There are plenty of great opportunities.
"I am pretty happy with the program (microbiology). I find myself taking some classes I would prefer not to, but that is fairly normal with any school."
"It is really easy, all you need to do is talk with an adviser."
"The facilities at K-state are very nice. Sometimes the cleaning needs to be more of a priority. The new recreation center is awesome, and each building has distinct character. Love love love the facilities at k-state."
The athletics are amazing here at Kansas State University. Everyone goes to the football games. The university definitely gets the word out for each event so that the students can be involved. Kansas State is a wonderful school when it comes to sports.
"Housing is great for freshman and those coming from out of state. The bathrooms that are shared between each floor get disgustingly dirty. The only problem I have is with cleanliness. The lifetopia program they use to set students up with the roommate is awful so beware, they don't set you up with the correct person. Jardine is nice for when you don't have many other options, the only thing is that the electric bills get extremely expensive and if you're unlucky you have a 25 minute walk to the other side of campus."
"Everyone here is so friendly and there's always something to do! Also, Kansas City isn't too far away if you wanted to get away."
Awesome! We have a huge variety to choose from! :)
"Everybody is so nice here, they will help you with what you need, and it is said that Bill Snyder chose to coach here because everyone was so nice and the atmosphere was great. The happiest college in the U.S.!"
"The dining halls are great with switching up meals and desserts are great, it's all quality food, but you get tired of it sometimes and want to go home for food."
There is absolutely no visitor parking ANYWHERE on campus and you also have to wait until 6 pm to get free parking. If you're a freshman/in the dorms you have to park about 10 minutes away and fight to the death for a spot.
"Although this isn't the school's fault, FAFSA really screwed me over. My parents were going through bankruptcy while I was stil a dependent, but since they were still making a lot of money, ""despite the fact that it was all going towards debt payments,"" FAFSA didn't give me anything."
It's the same as any other modern society. We've got all the standard fast-food and dine in chains with a small variety of personal restaurants.
For the most part K-state is a do what you want sort of school. If you adhere to the law you will never get in trouble. If you don't you probably won't get in trouble if you're not incredibly obnoxious.
It was harder than I thought to receive financial aid.
"I have never felt unsafe as I walk to class late at night, and they have spots throughout the campus to call for campus security guard to walk with you if you are nervous."
"The computers are generally fast, but there are not many computers that are available."
"nightlife for students who are 21 or older is great when it comes to bars and clubs, not so many options for those who are under age unless they enjoy house parties which do occur quite frequently and sound fun"
"Dining center is a good place to eat and see your friends, the lines can be long at times, but over all the food is decent and the atmosphere is great"
"The girls are all nice, but as a whole they could be more outgoing."
"I love my engineering degree, and I wouldn't change a thing. I plan on becoming and engineer without borders, working with my husband (master's degree in Agronomy) in other countries to improve their water and soil quality, while also helping them learn better and more efficient farming techniques."
The campus is so small you don't need a bus. Walking is the best way to get around if you don't have a bike.
It is Kansas so you get all kinds of weather. If it snows you get to go sledding. If its hot you go to the student union to hangout and watch movies for a dollar.
"The drug and alcohol scene at Kansas State is not visible. You do hear about parties but there seems to be no peer pressure about doing drugs or drinking alcohol. The usage also seems to be low. However, always stay alert and do not fall under peer pressure."
"Majority of the campus (girls and boys) are interested in being healthy. You always see people walking, running, riding their bikes or going to the gym. Both genders seem to be nice. In regards to clothing, you see the typical clothing you would see (jeans, leggings, t-shirts, dress, jacket). There are many activities to provide to the many interests in this large campus. People seem to be sociable, so do not be afraid to ask for help, get a tutor, or ask for directions."
"Kansas State provides many activities that students can participate in, like performances, concerts, movies, and dance classes and students want to participate and it is a great way to meet new people. Some of the buildings are hard to get into if you have a disability, but Kansas State will help you anyway they can. Its a pretty campus with a lot of scenery. Get involved and I think you will enjoy your time here."
"Kansas State is a very good school. The people are nice and most of the professors seem to be knowledgeable. Walking around campus is easy but can take awhile to get to one place to another as it is a large campus. The facilities are nice and up to date. Getting to places off campus can be hard if you do not have a car. The school is a little high in price to some schools, but apply for scholarships and I think you will enjoy coming to Kansas State."
"There are plenty of scholarships available, just kinda small."
"I love the College of Agriculture, I was a bit nervous at first because I wasn't sure what to expect but all the students are very accepting and all the professors are very open to helping students and are very concerned with making sure students understand the material."
"Manhattan has a wide variety of food, but unfortunately this includes a bunch of chain restaurants."
"My favorite thing about my school is I feel comfortable there, and that doesn't come easy for me. Even the staff are laid back people. It's like we all know we're part of a very big family there. I actually get to have one on one conversations with my teachers. The financial aid advisor is amazing the way she is always so busy but can still make time to set you straight when you ask. Facilities are top of the line of course, everything is always spotless,and usually in great condition. Campus life is whatever you have time to make it , but it is definetely there for you if your not working to much to enjoy it."
"Many students go for food and or drinks at Speakeasy. Applebees has karaoke on Monday nights at 9. The inferno is the party place but I don't go there, all I've heard is it's alot of fights. If you roller skate the Starlight is open on weekends. We all go to movies alot, if you get the cinemas rewards card it adds up nicely. Sometimes the Steifel theatre has comedy and/or concerts. There is also a live theatre on Iron street. Downtown is old school cool with shopping, antiques, coffee shops, and my favorite, ""Ad Astra book store and coffee shop with the best monster cookies."
"These are just not issues at K-state. We do have a large diversity in just about any area, but in general I don't think that most people care. I don't even know alot of my own friends beliefs or opinions on these issues, but I can easily tell that many of my friends come from very different backgrounds. We all accept eachother with our differences and for them. I can't imagine this being any kind of a challenge in this environment."
"For being a smaller University compared to some others in the United States, Kansas State has a very diverse group of students. While the student population is diverse, there is no doubt anyone who comes to Kansas State will find a group he or she will fit in with."
I did not have any trouble receiving financial aid here and the entire process has gone smoothly ever since. The financial aid advisers are incredibly helpful and very willing to help students explore options they hadn't considered before.
There is an incredible amount of diversity at Kansas State University between the world-class International Exchange Student program and the different extra-curricular clubs offered on campus. Kansas State University prides itself on its diversity as well as the classes taught about diversity in the world and multicultural studies.
Manhattan is not that big. But there are things to do and most are right by campus. Aggieville is a huge part of student life in Manhattan and its right across the street.
"There isn't a lot of drug use, but there is a lot of underage drinking. The RA's keep a good eye on it but students find a way around it. There have been times so far this year that people have gotten in trouble for drug use though."
"The social scene is fantastic. Everyone is friendly and out there. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you look like, finding friends is amazingly easy."
"I would never pick somewhere over Kansas State University. The halls are all beautiful, nicely kept, and easy to navigate. The student union has amazing food, multiple choices, and plenty of room. There is always something going on around campus and everyone is friendly."
"K-State truly feels like a family; an accepting and welcoming vibe is almost guaranteed on campus. Additionally, most teachers on campus are more than willing to go above and beyond with getting to know and assist students, in a way that you do not feel neglected within a large student body."
There are all kinds of different people everywhere.
"I am a pre-journalism major. That just means that I don't have enough hours or completed the required courses to declare my major yet. I love the program and learning about the history about journalism, advertising and public relations. If I could do it all over again, I would have picked this major again. My goals are to become a magazine photojournalist. The concerns I have with finding a job are that a lot of journalists have to be able to converge and do a lot of things that they aren't really an expert in."
"The food is always decent, and there is always a wide variety to choose from."
"Manhattan is a great town. It isn't as small and boring as many believe, and there are many things to do on the weekends."
"I received a good amount of aid at KSU, and it didn't take a a lot of applications. If you have good grades, you will likely get a good scholarship."
"I haven't had much experience with the police, but the residence halls are pretty relaxed, depending on who your RA is. Some floors have fun all the time, while others are strict."
"Absolutely incredible!!! Our football and basketball programs are elite programs in the nation. Our volleyball team is excellent as well. All three sports make the post season/bowl game regularly, and student attendance is incredibly exciting. The intramural sports are also a ton of fun and competitive."
"The majority of student parking is a ways away from campus. Its at least a quarter mile walk, which is painful in the winters. You will get ticketed for parking illegally. If you live on or near campus, you should be fine walking or with a bike. In order to get to walmart or anything though, you'll need one or need friends."
"The Derby Dining Center is fantastic. The food there is incredible, and you can always get your fill. They serve Call Hall dairy there, which is absolutely incredible. The Mexican and Asian food that they serve there is great"
"Kansas state is a school in a valley. The town is pretty much the school, but with that being said, we are a family. The students are super nice and great minded individuals. The atmosphere is perfect because we are doing really well with our sports teams and everyone is excited."
"housing and dining is pretty great. the meals are good, and the housing is kept clean."
There has been some drug safety promotion in Kansas State University. But Kansas State University focuses more on Health&Safety part of the campus than drug safety part.
Kansas State University tries to have many promotion on health&safety on campus. We also have Lafene Health Center that offers free appointments for students and also promotes women's health to students on campus.
Kansas State University has different clubs and programs to recruit more diversity into the current student body! Everyone are very accepting of these different diversity throughout the campus and emphasis that everyone are welcome to Kansas State University!
Kansas State University is A+ school for agriculture majors! I am currently attending Kansas State University to major in Animal Sciences and Industry with Pre-Vet Option. The environment around Kansas State University is very friendly and there are people who are very willing to help students out when they are lost or just need someone to talk to!
I am attending Kansas State University while majoring in Animal Sciences and Industry major with Pre-Vet Option. Kansas State University offers free tutoring and professors are very willing to take their time outside of class to help students. I didn't receive the A grade due to not taking these opportunities to my advantage but if I did I would be a A+ student!
"There are so many different kind of people at KState, I prefer the ag boys. If they aren't wearing boots then they aren't an option. It's pretty easy to classify people on how they look, in a non-judgmental way."
"I live on campus now and absolutely hate it. It is cheaper and less stressful off campus. There are a lot of option very close to campus, so that's a plus!"
"I feel like there is a lot to do in this town. It's not huge, so I feel safe. But yet it is diverse enough that you can find a lot to do."
"It was very easy to deal with, just wish I didn't need it!"
"Sometimes the wireless internet is slow but it is great to have all throughout campus. Printing is a hassle, I have my own printer"
KSU has wonderful opportunities for their students. Their facility offers research programs for students. This offers the students to work towards their future careers.
If you are looking for it you'll find it but it is not in your face
"The transportation at KSU is very helpful and convenient. They run a shuttle from one side of campus to another. Also, they run it across town and you may call whenever you need a ride. It's convenient late at night, as well. They will pick you up where you're at. If you don't feel safe walking somewhere, call them. They're all about safety."
"There are many people from all over the world. Lots of international students. The majority of people, however, are white."
I am an Animal Science major and I love my program! 126 hours are needed for completion of my undergraduate degree. The program allows me to meet the requirements for the program through classes that I want to take!
"They have a lot of different options for you to take. The professors (that I have had so far) are extremely good at communicating with the students about what is expected, and how they are willing to help. You have choices to take honors if you would like, and they have a lot of options like undergraduate research that are great for undergraduates to get involved with."
The food at the dining halls is alright. They have a bunch of different options. You can't use your meal dollars anywhere but the dining halls so this really hinders where you eat. I wouldn't recommend a meal plan unless you're living in the dorm halls.
"The girls are pretty similar honestly. A lot of them are very superficial, blonde but extremely attractive. They know they are attractive and it makes them feel very entitled to nice things and the ""perfect"" guy. But you will rarely run into some girls who have a good head on their shoulders, who are much smarter than you and don't mind and are incredibly attractive. Good luck fellas"
"The campus police is fairly lenient. They are very understanding but they do have to do their jobs, making sure that everyone on campus is safe. Safety is their main concern. They do not tolerate underaged drinking at all. If you drink, you run the risk of being arrested if you are underaged for drunk driving so don't do it."
they are pretty fast. there is actually a Dell technician in Hale Library.
"There are all sorts of people at K-state. You have the rich people from out of state, the military people, and of course the farming people. You can definitely tell which students are athletes because they all wear gray sweats and purple sweaters with a kstate backpack that has a number on it."
the weather is always changing. They do a really good job of making sure that the sidewalks and roads are clear on campus.
I've never felt scared or worried on campus. It is good lighting at night and has safe rides or blue lights in case of an emergency.
I haven't noticed students doing drugs on campus.
The school does an excellent job making policies far and up to par. They are very strict with Academic Dishonesty to keep everything fair among the students.
I have had a great experience so far with classes and professors. The complaint I have is how different a class can be just because it is taught by a different professor. I took a geology course and it was a breeze but a friend in the same class with a different teacher was barely passing because the class was completely different. we compared notes and barely anything matched up.
"I have received an average amount of financial aid. I haven't had any problems yet but I have heard some ""horror"" stories from peers. I do not have much to complain about personally though."
"The dorms around the derby complex are very connected and easy to get from one to the next. Also it is not far off campus and doesn't take much time to get from the bulk of the dormitories the heart of campus. The dorms are very clean when first moving in and the shared areas, lobbies and community bath rooms are kept very clean and in working order. The only complaint I would have is that they have had issues with the fire alarm system and we have had to evacuate multiple times for glitches late at night but I would rather have it glitch and go off then not work in an actual emergency."
I believe that Kansas State deserves a B because I have never felt like I was in danger but I do see room for improvement. The campus has the safe ride bus for people on campus and they also have the lit boxes that will provide assistance if needed when pushed. I believe that the campus police do an adequate job of keeping dangerous situations at bay.
"If you know what time of the year to look for housing it is really easy to find an apartment. Not all apartments are very cheap, but the majority of apartments are nice to live in. Personally I love my apartment, especially since I only live a couple blocks from campus, work, and downtown."
"The computers are usually crowded. Even during times when students are not pressed for study time, but especially around midterms and finals. If you have your own computer the WiFi is great and can be accessed all around campus. It does glitch up now and then, but usually it doesn't cause a problem."
"The police in Manhattan Kansas are some of the most vigilant and modern I have seen in Kansas. The fire department also keeps the businesses in town up to code, as well as the health department."
"KSU has a very diverse student base. Age, race, etc. The only sort of ""clique"" environment could be that the schools of engineering are bigger than most of the other areas of campus. But that doesn't really create any sort of ""elitist"" group."
It may have been easier for me to achieve financial aid since I am in the military. Also because of the fact that I have a family. But the process was simple because of the help provided. Pretty much a step by step process through the KSU website.
The price is pretty steep for people who are trying to support a family while going to school but it help regulate the amount of people parking in the lots so that you can find a spot closer to where you need to go.
"Bill Snyder is a legend, and every true K-Stater's heart bleeds purple for our football team. EMAW!"
"The food in Aggieville is excellent. Many places participate in the coupon book handed out at the beginning of the semester, and everything is within walking distance of campus."
"There are many transportation options to choose from on and off campus. SafeRide is a free option for students late at night and on the weekends, and taxis are readily available."
"They are excellent, and I feel that I have learned a tremendous amount at my time here!"
"In the winter time it can get pretty cold and snow sometimes, but its not too bad!"
There are buses and taxi's otherwise it is very easy to walk places because they are not far.
"In the college of Ed. they have both apple computers, and apple Ipads that work great for students to accomplish what they need to get accomplished."
It's usually terrible and there are usually little to nowhere to park.
KSU dominates the Big 12 in football. They are pretty well known in all sports and have super nice work out facilities.
"Frats here are viewed as people who need to 'buy' friends. There is no reason to be in one and no one expects you to be. At enrollment there are several frats/sorority's set up to try and catch transfer students. They are succesful at geting some to pay and join - but anyone who's been on campus knows that ""Greek Life"" is a huge waste. There are some exceptions where living in the dorms is more expensive then the frat and can make it worth joining. But most students just rent an apartment off campus and that way dont have to mess with the outragious living costs of a frat or dorms. Much much cheaper to live on your own.(speaking from experience)"
"Its Kansas, the weather changes regularly here. But overall, nestled in the flinthills the weather is pretty nice!"
"Campus student body is comprised of many different origins and nationalities. There isnt any favoritism towards or against any nationality, political offiliation, or economic background. Mostly strong conservative make up which I personally love about the campus. Its invigorating to see a group of young people who actually have morals, values, and religious beliefs and adhere to those beliefs rather then be sucked down with the rest of the world into accepting everything and everyone. The college promotes success in everyone."
"Wireless internet is free at KSU, but the connection isn't the best. It's unreliable at times and you can't even consider trying to use skype because the connection is so poor."
"I received some financial aid, but the requirements to keep my scholarships did not quite equate to the amount of money I am receiving."
"There is a wide variety of people at KSU. You'll never find two people who are exactly alike. The diversity is welcoming and everyone I've met is extremely friendly. Most of the attractive men are in frats and those who aren't necessarily attractive are usually gentlemen. All of the girls I have met are equally friendly. Overall, the people at KSU are very inviting."
The campus treats sports as a huge deal. Football is large right now because K-State is so good. Smaller sports are not given publicity.
I don't like the dining halls at K-State because the food isn't very good. It's very hit and miss.
"When you are first applying to the school, the opportunities for scholarships are abundant. After your freshman year, it's up to you to go and find those scholarships."
All the sports teams give their all. The students love supporting all the teams at K-State.
School spirit is an A+ at KSU. People are always sporting their purple and most are very involved in sports or as a fan.
Kansas State has a very strong sense of community and belonging. Attending school here makes you feel as though you are apart of something bigger than yourself. School spirit at athletic events and even just day to day activities is extremely strong and prideful.
"There is a lot of acceptance on campus. However, there is not a ton of diversity with regards to different religions. There is a large international program which makes for more diversity on campus."
The Architecture program is incredible at KSU. I have learned so much and I am only in my second year. With this program you receive a masters degree in only 5 years!
"Athletics are a really big deal at K-State, especially football. Attending games with friends is a blast and we're in a BCS bowl game this year! Volleyball, Women's Basketball, and Baseball are all free for students to attend and are also fun to watch."
Parking on campus is absolutely horrible. It is very limited and not close to any of the buildings.
I am a member of a sorority at Kansas State. Our Greek system is one of the best in the country. We have many of the top chapters on a national scale. 1 in 5 students identifies themselves as Greek. It is really a great experience.
"There are quite a few options for off campus housing, but the quality is relatively poor."
"The only computers that are available at Kansas State are in Hale Library. There is a limited supply and they are usually all full. It is recommended that you have your own laptop and printer. They do charge for printing at K-State, but you get a few free prints to start with. The WiFi that is on campus is alright, but often crashes."
Campus is not extremely strict. The things they are mainly strict about are the driving policies. You can't park anywhere your car isn't registered for or else you will get into huge trouble. The tickets are usually pretty pricey and student most likely can't afford them.
"Off-campus dining is really good! The restaurants are mostly cheep and if they are more expensive there are a lot of coupons that students can get around campus. The food is all different, there is only a couple chain restaurants, a lot of the other ones are fresh, new, and fun."
The off campus housing is not bad at all. Most are relatively close to campus yet some are a little far away and get annoying walking the distance. Another thing is that some parking lots are really small causing people to have to park on the streets. The availability is usually pretty good however the ones most available are usually the ones in the worse conditions.
"There's always something going on, it's just a matter of finding it. For Greek life, there seems to be a party every other night! Then the university itself has events every weekend, and sometimes during the week. movies at the union/bowling are my favorites offered by the university. If you are living in the dorms, the floor RA's tend to have something planned at least once a week. Then there is always Aggieville which is jam-packed with bars and restaurants, dancing, etc."
"The campus internet was relatively quick, but you have to pay per page to print. There were plenty of computer labs, and most of them had no wait for a computer. However, the engineering lab is usually much more busy, so there may be a wait there."
"There are so many places to go to in Manhattan! A couple of my favorite sit-down restaurants include: Olive Garden, La Fiesta, Longhorn Steakhouse, McAllisters, El Tapatio, Gambino's Pizzeria, and Harry's. My favorite sit-down faster food places include: Chipotle, Smashburger, and Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt."
"You'll find all sorts of guys at Kansas State! It definitely depends the college you are in. Ag college=ranchers, country boys and farmers. Architecture/art=artsy, trendsetters, and hipsters. Engineering = nerdy, yet awesome and kind young men. Great guys are everywhere on campus! And they tend to be polite and hold doors open for ladies-always a plus!"
"I ate at the derb complex and the food was pretty good. they changed it up pretty often and for people who wanted the same there was pizza, tacos, sandwiches, hot dogs and burgers every day. There was also a decent salad bar and a dessert table. Overall the food was pretty good and there was a good variety."
If i could do it again I would take more classes. I kinda eased myself into it and I realized that it was easier than you would expect. Most of the Gen Ed classes are pretty easy and its best to just get them out of the way as soon as possible.
The college of business is pretty easy to get into. You don't have to take a test or anything but you do need to keep a 2.5 GPA to stay in it.
I'm in the college of business and I love it. I think that the faculty is very knowledgeable and helpful when you are trying to learn and get help. The business program at K-State is very well thought out and you can take classes that really interest you.
Most people on campus are very nice. I can't walk to a class without seeing somebody I know. I feel like the community is very close. I am part of the greek community and I feel like I have met a lot of quality young men and women.
"The agriculture program is amazing in Kansas State University. They offer study abroad opportunities, helpful labs, orientations, job opportunites. The clubs involved in agriculture does lot of activities, such as product evaluation, observing agriculture products are processed."
"It is very hard to find a parking space unless you get up early. Sometimes the office makes unreasonable claim saying that you have far away from the apartment, although you live there. It may be due to recent new parking spots and new buildings. I guess they haven't figured out what is the best option for students."
"Wireless networks are available in all around campus. The library provides a number of computer seats that is enough for students on campus. Most of the buildings with help rooms have printers and it is convenient. However, the wireless internet becomes slow sometimes in the dormitory or in the apartment. The time line that is slows is usually at night about 10 pm. Other from that I think there is no problem."
"the classes are difficult but very plentiful in information, if you want to learn a lot this is where to be!"
parking is difficult during class times but the campus area is small enough that walking can get you any where and nearly any place in town is less than a 15 minute bike ride from the furthest classroom (with the exception of a few neighborhoods on the east side of town)
I'm in the engineering program and it is very tough but I know that just means I will learn a lot about the field and will become an effective engineer when I graduate. The teachers and advisers are always willing to help a struggling student and there are many graduates also willing to assist making it a friendly and beneficial place to study.
"There are lots of different off campus housing options to choose from. There are lots of houses that rent out individual bedrooms to students. Or if that's not enough privacy for you, there are loads of different apartment complexes around Manhattan where you can find that privacy at very affordable pricing. The only downside of living off campus is the lack of street lights. This might sound wierd, but because of the fact that Manhattan is a relatively small town, people walk quite a bit. So you might be aware of the fact that if you walk to an activity on campus at night, walking back can be a bit nerve racking as there aren't many street lights on the residential streets. Manhattan is a fairly safe small town, but walking the streets at night on poorly lit streets is probably just not a good idea for a female in any are. Other than that, Manhattan living off campus is easy and affordable."
"I am in the Architecture, Planning and Design program, and i have been over satisfied with my education so far. I have attended different colleges, whether to take classes or just go on a campus tour, and can say that i am proud i chose this one. Everybody wants you to succeed. Even in our department, people help eachother out, they don bicker at ""competition."" The teachers are more than challenging, but they hold each student to their own limits. The resources are crazy attainable, and the professors are great with working with you should you need further help. Getting to know them at a personal level really pays off too, especially if you need a job!"
"Getting into my major wasn't a problem, because I tried really hard in high school. I will say though, if you're not math and science oriented, do not join engineering, because you will find yourself taking on more than you can handle."
"The community is unlike anything I've ever seen. It's an incredibly friendly and respectful atmosphere. I've never felt discriminated against, ignored, insulted, or distressed since I've come here. I don't think you can get that feeling anywhere else."
"I cannot play sports, so i do not know how intimate the relationships are between players and within the teams, but i do know Colin Klein kicked BUTT this year!! And that the teams will continue to do their best."
"My only real problem with the program is the class sizes. It can be difficult learning in a person lecture hall, but that's what you get at a major University. The instructors are very helpful though and all the ones I've met are happy to help you one on one during their office hours. Also there's tutoring for almost every class if you fall behind."
"Being in mechanical engineering at K-State is pretty cool, but I wish the general class sizes were smaller. I guess its common for a university to have giant classrooms, but still. Other than that all is well."
"I have never felt unsafe on this campus. The only fears i have ever had are my own fears about walking alone at night, but even then there are safe spots and the campus police willing to assist anyone. The students are not violent, and the parties stay on the edges of campus."
"I came here for the Architecture Planning and Design program, and have not been let down at all. I have had a lot of medical issues and got to see how willing my adviser and professors were to work with me to maintain good grades and do as well as possible. They were able to answer any of my questions. The workload is tough in this program, but manageable if this is what you want. The registration process is simple, the study areas are so accessible! The only bad thing is that its so expensive. Lol. But nothing that wont pay off in the end."
Kansas State University has a great range of diversity in the student population. There are mainly white people here but there are still a great amount of other races as well. As well as people with different political and religious view.
Manhattan may be a small college town but there is still a lot to do here and I can't complain. The people here are extremely friendly and I feel safe walking home alone at any given time. Everything is easily accessible even if you do not have a car.
"K-State has a great assortment of off campus dinning. Many restaurants are within walking distance, offer a student discount, and are affordable. Many local restaurants deliver as well which is great for a late night of studying!"
"Most of the buildings are gorgeous and have that old-schooly, just plain classy look and feel. There are some dorms that are brick and look a little less appealing to the eye, but rest assured, they are all cleaned every day"
"There are emergency alert stations everywhere, and the campus grounds themselves are very well lit; you'd feel comfortable letting your girlfriend or sister walk home at night (Bro-tip: don't ever actually do that). Campus security and the local police are very vigilant, but not overbearing. For example: if you're caught in your dorm room drinking under-age and being generally noisy, they will find out and you will get in some deep, stinky trouble. However, my friends and I like to do some amateur parkour on campus late at night, and we've been stopped multiple times by campus police and/or actual cops, but they've always been fine with our shenanigans once we explain ourselves and they realize we're not damaging university property, only ourselves"
"Everyone is nice and friendly. I have had a good experience since the first time I came and visited campus. I knew right from the beginning that I was coming here no matter what. I have started volunteering, working, and joined a couple clubs. I love being here and feel like anyone would!"
"I currently work in the dining hall, but do not live on campus. I enjoy working there and the people I work with. Some of the food is interesting and doesn't taste fantastic all the time. I know they can't make gourmet meals for 1,000's of kids, but I wish it was better."
"My Campus's Security – Kansas State University is a big campus, but has acquit security on campus. Campus police are regularly seen making their rounds twenty four hours a day. Also there are emergency buttons placed all over campus so I feel very safe during the day. However, I have found at night that only main sidewalks have proper lighting while less commonly used paths have little to no lighting so I must to take out of the way paths at so I have lights to see by."
"There are such a variety of majors to choose from! I just declared a business major. It was not difficult at all I just went to the office in Calvin hall and they set me up with an advisor. I know you can't officially specifically declare your business major (marketing, managing, finance, etc) until you have 45 credit hours. You also just have to have a 2.5 gpa."
Our football is top of the line! Everywhere you look someone is wearing purple. SO MUCH SCHOOL SPIRIT!
I do plan on doing an internship at some point toward the very end of my degree completion. I have already contacted a couple of organizations for internship.
Athletics are very important at KSU - but the focus is very family oriented - with the Bill Snyder Family Stadium. Our football team is more than likely going to be playing in a BCS bowl this year.
I believe the application process was fairly simple. I do remember being very anxious about finding out if I was accepted. I think GPA was the most important criteria for admission.
"I love that I am entering the Family Studies Human Services program at KSU at such an exciting period of learning about marriage, families, and human development. I would absolutely do it again, except I would have to consider the cost - very expensive with virtually NO scholarships available for merit."
I am a non-traditional student who is in the Family Studies Human Services Program at KSU. I can nearly ALL of my classes via WIMBA classroom which is a distance learning tool. I would not be able to obtain this degree without KSU having this Distance Learning program.
"Diversity on our campus is something we pride ourselves on. We even have multiple groups on campus to help students connect with each other and keep their culture alive. These groups are also a way of educating anybody else who is willing to learn about a different culture, belief, race, etc."
I notice security on campus frequently and there are quite a few lights throughout campus if you are there late. There are also blue emergency lights set up intermittedly so if for any reason you feel unsafe you can press the button and security will be there for you immediately.
"Campus security is amazing. I feel safer walking around campus at night than I did around my home town of 600 people. The campus is always well lit with ""blue-light' security buttons around campus that will put you in contact with campus security if pressed. Wildcat Walk is also an available service that I have used frequently. If you feel unsteady about traversing campus alone then merely call Wildcat Walk and a friendly campus police officer will walk you wherever you want to go for free!"
"The weather in Kansas is always unpredictable. It can be raining one day, blazing hot the next, and then snowing a few days later. You can never tell. Be prepared with your wardrobe and it won't hinder your class schedules. The buildings are always cool in the warmer months and toasty warm in the winter."
"Parking permits cost $170. There are parking lots located all around the campus. If you're an incoming freshmen be prepared to have the worst parking available, but your parking permits allow you to have better places if you stay at the university."
Even though Manhattan is small there are plenty of dining opportunities.
"There is a lot of diversity at k-state. If you're not fond of minorities, you probably won't enjoy it here. There can be a bit of a language barrier with the Asian community, but other than that everyone's nice regardless of their skin color. Ya for non-racism! Like most of America the majority of students is white, but minority make up about 30 percent of campus."
"K-state has a large variety of people. It's difficult to generalize as a whole, but for the most part everyone is extremely friendly. There are plenty of beautiful women and plenty that seem a little to plain. The level of intelligence is much higher than what you would encounter in Lawrence though. People aren't as focused on getting drunk as they are on studying. Having said this, K-state does have a lot of party goers as well. In the end though, it's easy to find the type of people you're comfortable being with, and if there's a crowd you're not particularly fond of, they tend to keep out of other people's business. Everyone is very respectful. Having said that, some of the sorority girls can be incredibly ditsy."
"The food is okay but for the amount of money that students pay for a meal plan at this university, the food is not up to par."
I absolutely love my major and the classes that are associated with it. I got a great academic advisor and i have a plan for my academic future.
The facilities are pretty nice. Although i wish there were some more places around the area for minors to hang out.
"WE are very up to date workout facilities and the social life is pretty nice. However, the parking facilities are not plentiful, which can be quite bothersome."
"There are so many people of different races at this school. Now the acceptance that students have for this diversity varies, but for the most part, everyone gets along!"
K-State has a small town atmosphere. However there is still a lot to offer. Right off campus is Aggieville where most of students time is spent. There is also a mall with a store I love and have never heard of until I got there it's called Rue21. There is also numerous parks. It is a pretty laid back town with a homey feel.
I feel completely safe at K-State. The dorms are always locked and nonresidents can't get into the building without someone who actually lives there. They have emergency buttons all around the campus. They also have Wildcat walk. Wildcat walk is where if you feel unsafe walking home at night by yourself someone will come and escort you to your dorm. Everyone at K-State is super nice so their normally isn't any problems
"I absolutely hate living in the dorms. All of the people living on my floor of the dorm are weird and unsociable. I have tried my best to make friends, but no matter what I do, they do not respond. I want to move out of the dorms as soon as possible, because I do not want to risk getting a rude, obnoxious and loud roommate like the one I have now."
"KSU has an amazing football program. Despite the fluke from yesterday's game, the entire school supports and praises our football team as well as Coach Snyder. Unfortunately, I cannot say much more about the other sports, as I have no interest in them."
There is a high graduation rate for many careers. Students have countless tools to help them in every class and earn a good grade.
Everyone is friendly and inviting. You can ask anyone a question and they are more than happy to help.
"From a small town perspective, this town has alot to offer. There are many shopping options besides Walmart and there is the mall. The only bad part is that there aren't really many options for under 21 students to hang out and have a good time in Aggieville. I understand that there are alot of bars there but it's really inconvienent when your friends want to meet up at this bar but you can't even get it because you're underage, though you weren't planning on drinking anyway."
"we only recently got a shuttle system so we are trying to work out the kinks but so far, from what I've heard, the system is terrible. Sometimes they're late or they don't have many stops on and off campus. Besides public transport, parking is terrible too. There is a limited number of spaces in the parking garage, which isn't fair for those who pay for that parking. Along with the parking garage, dorm parking is bad. I had to walk a few blocks just to get to my car, which was particularly bad when it was dark or it was freezing cold. The parking spaces that are close to the dorms are few and small in between."
Our weather can throw you for a spin but it allow us to dress fun. We can wear shorts in the winter and coats in the summer.
"K-State do what no other school can. We have the smartest, the funest, the most creative group of students around. The best part is we all just met and are like family."
Easy process in getting a parking permit. Parking lot isn't too far away.
"Quiet hours in dorms, sliding cards to get in to dorms, etc"
"I am not involved in the Greek life, but my roommate is in a sorority and enjoys it very much."
"It just depends on how you apply yourself and what connections you make with professors. For me, it's been great."
"I love the weather here. I've grown up in Kansas and have been to every part of the U.S. and, however unpredictable, it's my favorite place. It's home."
Kansas State University offers so much school spirit and unity through different clubs and activities. One of these main times is during sports seasons where a lot of the school's students come together and see our teams kick-butt!
I love the look of K State! Some of the building remind me of a Irish castle which is so gorgeous to look at while you walk around campus! The rec is very welcoming to those who want to get fit although it is a little small it still offers so many opportunities. Hale library is absolutely great and has so many little study rooms to sit down and get your homework done for the night while looking through floors and floors and multiple catalogs and a huge database to find anything you need.
"Manhattan has a lot of cute older looking houses and if you have a good landlord you could easily get a good deal but in the end it is still a college town thus, you will probably pay more than you should when renting a house. My housemates and I found a great house for a fairly cheap price and fixed utilities and that was our main goal and we are close to school so we don't have to go far for class!"
"Very expensive, poor maintenance and mostly slumlords."
I do not have transportation. I depend on public transportation and walking to and from those stops and then through it at school is a hassle. But I manage to make things work.
If you dont have family local or dont like cooking your options are fast food. Most people gain a lot of weight when they go to college because they eat out a lot.
"Manhattan has a wide variety of places to eat, but most are typical fast food chains. No restaurants are exclusive to the town or the area. One advantage is that each end of town has the same fast food chains so they are conveniently located for all students regardless of where they live. Most places are reasonably priced for a college budget."
The library is a great resource for student because of the available space and helpful staff. The campus provides numerous clubs and activities to get involved in and regularly advertises events. The facilities are up to date and have the best technology I have seen at any university.
Kansas State has a very welcoming atmosphere at the school and in the community. As you as you get to Manhattan you feel like a Wildcat! The school is helpful with any needs a student might have!
The diversity at K-State is incrediable. I see awesome mixtures of all sorts of people working together to thinks accomplished. They even have a study hall called signified 212 as the class name because in that class was where all students meet up to share ideas and become social. 212 also signified the boiling point for water and in that class there is so much energy and good positivity everywhere. As far as religion I saw many people who have beliefs that stimulate from the middle east and nothing was different about the way they look or how they were treated.
"It's not really that strict as far I know, you need to obey the rules tho."
"They'll work with you as best as they can, there's no guarantee for success if you're in need of help."
"There's so much to do here. Parties, the recreation at the student union, sports games, and the list goes on."
"Kstate has it's own culture and tradition. Despite being in the middle of Kansas which is in the middle of nowhere, there's so much to do here and you'll never feel left out at all."
"I would say that the style for the students here are very similar, it's also easy to have friends and even start a relationship if you are looking for one here at Kstate."
In the library there are Mac and Dell computers. They are both really reliable computers and work fairly well. The only thing is that during certain periods of the day they are really crowded. You just have to know when to use them and when not to. I love the printing feature here. As a full time student you get $10 of printing per semester.
Majors are either to much work or not enough. My major currently is Public relations and it is not enough work. i dont like it because i feel as if i am learning nothing. but they are very informing about mass media and its effect on society in every class. So it get you more aware.
"sociology is all lecture, extremely boring. students learn more when they have more input and the activities are group."
"The process of getting into the Education program is pretty easy. I have to take all of the required general education classes, and I have to take an ""Early Field Experience"" course in which I teacher aid at a school in the area twice a week. The PPST Test must also be passed in order to get into the program, unless you have a composite ACT of 26 or higher. After that, you are admitted into the program."
"Greek Life is an incredible opportunity at K-State. It allows you to get extremely involved on campus and in philanthropic activities, have leadership positions, and make great friends. Every sorority has chapter houses that house at least 60 girls, and most fraternities have housing as well."
"I've only been to the dining hall once or twice in the dorms, but the food on campus open to everyone is pretty good. There's several options (Panda Express, Chic-fil-A, Denny's, Taco Bell, etc) and they are pretty reasonable."
During the day I feel completely safe walking on campus but at night there are some unlit areas where I don't always feel comfortable.
"There is a wide variety of people here at K-State, from the hicks to the jocks, very religious, crazy party people, and the ones who just fit in. Everyone is extremely friendly and overall happy."
"I'm coming from New York as a transfer from a school called Lynn university i chose Kansas state over university of Alabama because of the friendly atmosphere, the academics as a political science major are amazing and the wildcat sports/pride is amazing who can ask for more."
There are always parties going on around campus and if the party life doesn't suit you there are bars near campus open late
very reliable wireless internet access available to all students anywhere on campus
There is a large selection of bars and restaurants within walking distance of campus.
Our football team is top of the country. VERY HIGH IN SCHOOL SPIRIT
If I had to do it all over again I would definitely still be in my accounting major.
Our academic programs that the college of Business requires are quite helpful in the real world of getting a job that is also a career.
The meal prices are rather high in my opinion for our dining halls.
I love the resources that our campus provides. Hale Library is by far one of my favorite ones!
"I decided chemistry after taking the intro chemistry classes, and I love it. the only thing I would do differently is look into chemical engineering, I will eventually get a degree in that I feel."
"We are a strong crowd that likes to tail gate and we support our wildcats. The rec. here is nice and they are adding on to it, but our athletes, especially our basketball players, are full of themselves and are annoying to listen too, they do not try at school."
Very diverse campus. Students are very accepting to each other.
Very clean facility. Food is fresh and at an acceptable temperature.
I live near where international students mainly live and it is very diverse. Not only is it diverse in the living areas but in the heart of campus as well. There are many people from around the world who come here with different cultures and there are groups and organizations based on religious and political views.
Manhattan is not a huge town but Kansas State University is what makes the town. It has a home feeling to it and people are very welcoming to new people. There are local stores that are great to have for college students and different kinds of resturaunts. As of now there is a lot of construction being done on the stadium and recreation center so that will be something worth waiting to see.
"There is no official public transportation in Manhattan, KS. Free shuttles are provided for campus residents for weekly trips to Walmart or the dining centers, but if you don't have a car (or a friend that can drive you), it's hard to get around."
"I live in the Jardine Apartments, which are very nice but still a little overpriced. Finding a spot in housing is highly competitive and searching for roommates can be downright frustrating, but despite these difficulties, the apartments offer a nice place reasonably close to campus."
"The campus is surrounded by many apartment complexes with a verity of renting options. Some of the places are expenses to stay at, but most are easy to pay if you have roommates. Most of these places are with in an easy car or bicycle ride from campus."
"You must buy a permit to park on a car on campus and this permit is costly. This permit will only allow you to park in certain spots on campus and you will be ticketed if you park anywhere else. However, all parking places are mostly within walking distance walk from buildings. The furthest you will normally have to walk from your car is ten minutes max to reach the place you parked it."
Manhattan is a small town but it is slowly growing. There are lots of fun activities to do!
"Trasportation is available for everyone, especially on weekends when people go out to party and drink. They really care about students, and they don't want them to drive when they drink"
I don't give an A becuase sometimes it gets really loud at night and that's kind of annoying
"It's a nice weather here, but what makes it not perfect is that it rains when it's not expected. Very hot in the summer and humid in the summer."
The Bus comes to the school every hour so one can ride formhome to campus then return home via the bus.
"Wheni travel to the campus i usually look out tto see what the weather is like then dress for it, once on campus depending on the season i park close to the building i use have parking."
"Only way to go. If you want to be influential at K-State, then go greek."
Everyone goes crazy for the Cats no matter what sport it is. Football games shut down the entire town and big basketball games are similar.
It doesn't go anywhere worth while. No one knows the schedule. Not advertised.
"The campus is an extremely safe place, the campus police are present but do not seem overbearing and the health clinic is relatively near by."
"Anywhere you go in Manhattan and even anywhere in Kansas, you are bound to meet people who support and cheer for K-State. The pride that surrounds the school is great."
Several computer labs are normally crowded but there are always so alternative ones that you can find several open computers. You just had to take an extra 3 minutes to go to the next computer lab.
"Fall and Spring bring out the best of mother nature. On the other hand, summers and winters bring out the extremes with either sweltering temperatures or a shivering atmosphere"
Many apartment living options near campus and are usually furnished. Cheaper apartments are further from campus.
"The bars are for 21 and older, so if you are not that, avoid them. Fraternity parties seem to be the safer choice but may be hard to get in if you don't know anyone."
Parking Garage gets full quickly and the offered parking lots are usually full during the day. Try to park early otherwise you will be late.
City Buses – The city buses are probably the best mode of transportation if you don't have your own they have a drop off and pick up station very close to the school. They are inexpensive and there are several buses that run at different times.
"I have had an excellent experience with all of the teachers, advisers, and other faculty members. All of them care about the student, and put the student first. It is amazing what they will do to make sure the students enjoy their time here."
"Attempted but Not Succeeded – It is require for all students to take an Alcohol Awareness program. It is their attempt at lowering the use of drugs, or at least trying to get students to be safer about it. However, I do know that some of the students thought that was a joke and continued anyways."
"Very Good – I actually like my major courses. the teachers are great. the work load is not too bad, but expect to do upper college work."
Pretty Darn Good – I have not seen any drug use since I've been on campus.
"Needs More Diversity – Coming from a big city with lots of diversity, Kansas state doesn't have that much, but they are improving."
"Small Town – I come from a big city, and Manhattan, ks is small."
"Greatest Campus Ever! Kansas State University is the most friendly, spirited, spiritual and fun universities in the US. From football to going to classes, everyone is always wearing the school colors and is extremely friendly. The overall from academics to greek life, K-state, in my opinion is one of the greatest universities in the country! I don't think I could have made a better choice than K-state! Go State! EMAW!"
Walking Is Best – Taxis are a little slow but most of the time everything you need is on campus anyways so walking is best. Carpooling is also a fun option to see how many people can fit into one car at a time.
"No Clubs – Too much drama in the clubs, 21 yrs and older is most of the bars, but many house parties with lots of kegs and jungle juice. There is also a free service at night to take you to your house if you get too drunk."
"On the Way up – History shows that KState Athletics were not important, but now we are showing that we have a football team and basketball team. We are here to play."
Teachers are more than willing to help and offer services to students based on an individual need.
Teachers Care – The teachers are working experts of their subjects and care about the students. They often offer to come in early or stay late to help students.
"Transporatition is great at K-State. If living in the dorms, walking is all you have to do! There is also a lot of great housing around the university that is walking distance. There is an apartment complex that provides bus transporation from the univeristy for free; what a great deal! Long distance transporation is tricky because it requires driving and finding a parking spot!"
"A Greek Welcome – Greek life at K-state is very different and makes a huge part of the University. The Greeks are responsible for a lot of the activities and happenings outside of the University. Most Greeks are also very friendly and outgoing! Most of the Greeks are not afraid to reach out and say hi!
I rated this a B+ because not all Greeks are the same. There are those Greeks that are not very welcoming or outgoing. Overall the Greeks are a great part of this university."
"Someone Like You! At K-state you will always find someone like you. You will neve be lonely because other people are always in the same situation that you are in. At this univeristy, people tend to find those who are similar in character and interests as themselves. I rated this a 'B' because cliques are obviously seen. Cliques are pretty average, hints the 'B' rating. Overall, K-state is a friendly university to attend, there will always be a buddy to hang with. However, there will always be those 'groups' who seem to have more power than others."
Yeah Aggieville is the place to be but not much for under 21. Frat/house parties are more fun
"Your Friendly Neighborhood University – If my first university didn't hold such a high place in my heart, Kansas State would have taken its place. I opted to live in apartment-style housing rather than the dorms, so I didn't make as many connections my first year, but the ones I did were very special. The people here are so eager to accept you as part of their community; both on and off-campus. The first week of school was full of free homemade ice cream, ""how are you's"" and ""hope to see you around campus!"". I even had a professor invite me to a football game with her family!"
"Everyone Is Rooting for You – Being a Food Science major means that you get to access facilities within the greater College of Agriculture; a grain mill, dairy farm, meat lab, microbiology and food safety lab, bakery science lab and dairy plant. Scholarships and job opportunities are looking for K-state students specifically, and any Food Science major can apply to jobs and scholarships for Agriculture students. The professors have likely worked for the industries you could be applying to! There is a great variety of courses available and areas for students to specialize in."
"College-Oriented, but Pedestrians Take Note – Manhattan, KS is a college town. You can't go anywhere without seeing the school colors or mascot adorning its inhabitants or businesses. But from my perspective, it focuses on the partying students more often than not. Manhattan has a zoo, cultural center, mall and plenty of restaurants to choose from, but the main attraction for the Wildcats is Aggieville, a stretch of bars and pubs. The layout of the town is expansive such that students without cars may find themselves in for a bit of a walk."
"Engaging, Knowledgeable Professors – I enrolled in K-State's Food Science program because I had heard it was one of the best in the country. I heard correctly. The professors are extremely qualified and try their absolute hardest to make sure that the students understand what they are being taught while still being challenged. They are always available after class to help with questions or just to discuss current issues in the industry. Upper level class sizes are small and the professors are passionate enough about their courses to engage even the most disengaged student."
"theres 3 dining options on campus - van zile, derby, and kramer. Derby is really big and a little overwhelming, Van Zile is small and the atmosphere is like a restaurant, and Kramer is medium sized relative to the two other dining areas. Van Zile is only open to those who live in the Strong Complex but you can get in if you call ahead and reserve your spot, or if you have a friend who can get you in using a guest pass. the reason why they limit the people who eat there is because it's really small. you can buy 10, 15, or 20 meal plans per week but if you miss a meal, it won't roll over to the next week. Which basically means, if you miss a meal, oh well. I think that there is a variety in the meals and there is always the general pizza/pasta/burger/taco/deli options. But it does get a little boring later on in the school year. So there are other places you can buy your food from - the Student Union! It's a tad bit expensive and you can't use your meal plan there but it's got Panda Express, Subway, and other restaurants there."
"Manhattan KANSAS – I love K-state! Manhattan is definately a small college town, but it has a mall, and Aggieville which has lots of bars and restaurants. It also contains the dusty bookshelf which has a very very old but super cute cat :) My favorite experience was when we drove out to Tuttle Creek and looked up at the night sky and was able to see the milky way because there was no light pollution. I have never seen so many stars, it was so much better than any planetarium. I would choose K-state again if I could do it all over, I love the people there, the professors are all very considerate and the 5 year masters architecture program is ranked 5th in the NATION! after all those prestigious universities like harvard and cornell haha"
These classes get better in the higher level courses.
Close to Campus – Gotta get your place early. They run out quick and are fairly priced.
Food Is Good. You will have tried everything before the end of your first semester.
All the lots close to campus fill up really quick.
"The community has so much school spirit! I love being in Manhattan, especially during football season; The whole town is painted purple. There is a district across from the campus called, Aggieville. Aggieville is full of bars and restaurants and stores. There is a program called SafeRide that chauffeurs students around after drinking and it's completely free. The atomisture of Manhattan, KS is wonderful and I love the town."
It Could Be Better – I received hardly any financial aid from Kansas State. I wish there were more options for aid.
The first thought I had about going to K-State was it was going to be a predominately white school. I was pleasantly surprised. There are many international students that make the school ethnically diverse. There are also many different political beliefs and much activity in the school's political clubs. There is a fair amount of gay/lesbians at Kansas State also.
"Off Campus Is the Way to Go – I live off-campus and I love it! Apartments and houses in Manhattan are fairly cheap as long as there are roommates to help pay. There are plenty of places to live; many options. A couple cons of living off-campus would be the parking in crowded streets and the chance of a roommate who isn't great. However, there is a lot more freedom than dorms and not to mention people living on their own are more prepared once they graduate."
"Old Housing – The housing on campus belongs to the school is really good but they are really expensive. The houses off-campus are really old and sketchy. Sometimes people hears about bed bug not from your bed but they come from the house, since the beds were new!!! It is pretty safe and there is a lot of polices patrolling. Not so many parking on campus, the school are planning to expanse it. There is a lot of housing options."
The most girls and guys that would get the most fun around here would be greeks. The football guys and basketball guys are easy and out-going too. You can sometimes see them at the bar so every girl fans have a chance to hook-up. The styles of the girls are pretty good and the guys style is manly. I like it.
THE COST – FOOD IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE SINCE MAJORITY OF THE STUDENTS AROUND THE CAMPUS CAN AFFORD TO BUY THEM
INFORMATION SCIENCES – THIS IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE PEPLE TO KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON IN THE INFORMATION CENTERS SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE GOOD USE OF THIS INFORMATION
Not That Great – The on campus housing at K-state isnt all that great they barely have enough room for all the students
Everyone Is Welcome – Diversity at Kansas State is actually very accepting and unique. I mean i already felt like I was at home before I even steped foot on campus. I received many fliers and information on diversity and welcoming new students to the school. It is very diverse and I think that this is a great school for students. There are often many gatherings and events that welcome all students and there are also clubs for people to feel accepted in.
"In or Out – The process of getting into the program at Kansas State took a lot of hard work and creativity. In order to be accepted, you had to write an essay and fill out a separate application and from there you were selected among 100 plus students. It was a great honor to receive the letter of acceptance into the program and it is very satisfying being here now. Some tips of admission would be to start early, always start early with design and art classes. High school is a great stepping stone into that."
"My Future – I am very happy with the program and I would do it all over again if I had the opportunity. Although I have only completed one year there, it has shaped so many different ways for me to succeed in. As of right now, i have set many goals for myself in which i hope to achieve. In my future, i would like to work with major companies that deal with big cities and management in design of clubs and places where people are entertained. I hope to receive the tools and knowledge from Kansas State in order to be successful in what I do with my future."
"What Makes It Special – Being in the field of Interior Design at Kansas State University is a very elite program to be a part of. There are some of the best teachers and staff in the nation, which makes their program ranked as well. I enjoy it because you get to show your personality in the projects that you create. They do set boundaries, but within those boundaries you are able to show who you are and show your style which makes you feel more of a part of the program. The curriculum is very strict, but manageable. They give you the tools you need to succeed and to know what you want to do in your future. They encourage you to go beyond and to exceed those boundaries while maintaining the uniqueness and the craft of a true designer."
Great Instructors and Facilities – I attend K-State at Salina in the professional pilot program and the instructors excel in passing their knowledge to future pilots and the aircraft for students are top of the line and well maintained
"Peer Pressure – Peer Pressure is not a problem in this campus, people respect your stand on drugs or alcohol"
"Good Enough – Punishments are rational, The board understands the phase of what most students are going through"
"Lots of Options, but Don't Need Them – You don't need a house to find friends. Greeks aren't super popular but people don't really make fun of you if you join."
"There's always something to do in the 'Ville, even if you aren't 21."
"Not a Lot – There aren't many big scholarships, especially after freshman year."
Love It! It's big enough that nobody notices if you skip class but if you really need help with a class there's lots of help available.
Go to Aggieville – Aggieville is still fun even if your 18. Some places have raves that are pretty cool. A chance to hang out and meet so many people.
"Manhattan is a small town. Let's not let that confuse anyone. It's nice having the mix of a small town feel, yet so much to do. One example is our local hang-out spot, Aggieville! It's a street lined with bars and dining houses for everyone to enjoy. Great music and fun activities take place every day of the week. The weekends are the best though! Aside of the college hangout, the town has much scenery and cool hot spots. Overall, it gets an A!"
There is plenty of off-campus housing in Manhattan. The problem is that apartments are very pricy compared to other cities for what you are getting.
"Small Roads and Expensive Permits. Kansas State did just build a new parking garage on campus, however, that doesn't change the fact that the roads are narrow and navigating through them with thousands of students walking about is extremely difficult. Also, paying for a parking pass without the guarantee of a parking spot seems a little ridiculous to me."
"Important Part of Campus, but Not the Only Part – An estimated 20% of K-State students are involved in the Greek system, so their presence is not to be underestimated. There are 11 sororities and nearly twice as many fraternities. Most houses are viewed positively by non-Greeks. They dominate some activities, such as Homecoming, but the social atmosphere doesn't revolve around the Greek system (unless you're in the Greek system)."
"The joke is that if you don't like Kansas weather, wait five minutes. Kansas has four distinct seasons. The only one that is detrimental to the campus experience is winter. There aren't on-campus transportation options like buses, so be prepared to walk through the snow, because class is rarely cancelled."
"Not Needed – At this time, there aren't many on-campus transportation options. The University and City of Manhattan are working on developing more bus routes to include on-campus destinations. Honestly, it's not needed. Once you're on campus, all buildings are easily within walking distance. Parking can be tricky, but most students find a spot."
"Pretty Safe – I have never felt unsafe on K-State's Campus. There are call stations located around campus that will alert campus police if you need help. Additionally, there is a service called Wildcat Walk, if you feel uncomfortable walking alone at night. A police officer or security guard will meet you and accompany you to your destination. There are very few instances of crime or theft. The most common incidence is bicyclists pulled over for riding on the sidewalk."
"Best Parties Ever – We have a little bar strip called Aggieville. You don't have to go if you aren't into partying at night, but in the morning, they do have great specials on food. It's even cheaper than buying food somewhere else off campus."
"It seems like every day no matter the time, you can't ever find parking. Even if you have paid for the parking pass or garage pass, you still can't find parking. You are either racing with people to get into a parking spot or you are waiting an hour before class just to have a secure parking spot."
"Finding Jobs for the Future – I really love my major. It has not only helped me network with more people in my field at the school, but also outside of school. I have been able to travel throughout the county to learn more about my major and they not only tell us about what's going on in our industry, they help us to find jobs once we graduate and internships in our industry. I love that."
"The food was good depending on which complex you lived in and what choices they had. I only ate pizza and french fries because I really didn't like anything else. If they had more options, then I would've eaten more food."
"Kansas State University has a great curriculum system and I was very pleased when I came to this University. I am glad to say that next year, I will be a alumna of Kansas State University. The coursework that you learn throughout your years at this school will help you in your future."
Aces in My Book – You will find a pretty even distribution of guys and girls ranging from all different ethnicities and backgroiunds. You cant walk from class to class without seeing someone with a smile or a friendly face.
Your Second Home – There was never any major crimes while I was there. Just the occassional petty theft from people not locking their doors and what not. For the most part its a safe and homely place to live.
Off the Charts – Campus housing at Kansas State is very student friendly and supplies everything a student could need. Housing in dorms provides a very 'homely' atmosphere and all for a reasonable price. You will make many new friends and expperience many new things that you will remember forever!
Student and Cost Friendly – Public transportation is for the most part easily accessible and they have SafeRide which runs thursday-sunday till 3am and its free for all students.
"The Campus Is Boring. There's not much to do on campus, or in town. Salina is pretty boring."
Police Do Most of the Work. Salina is very heavy into DUI's and drug related convictions. The low key drug and alcohol scene is mainly because the Salina police focus on those convictions and do substandard work for any other crimes.
"Public transportation is the best option. Taxi's are expensive. The Salina campus has no shuttles. The bus costs $30/month for unlimited rides, but doesn't run after 10 pm or on Sundays. If you can afford it, bring your own vehicle."
"Too Laid Back. The punishments for cheating are too lenient. Campus security is a joke. Things get stolen all the time. Returning stolen items is almost non-existent. If you go to the Salina campus, keep everything with you at all times, and you will be fine."
"Lots of Labs, Lots of Space. It feels like sometimes we have more computers than students, and other times we don't have near enough. I recommend getting your own laptop"
Aggieville Is a Blast – You can't go anywhere and find the atmosphere or the drink specials you can in the 'ville.
"Drinking Is More Popular – In the crowd that I have gotten into, the drinking scene is way more popular than the drug scene, however the drug scene is still somewhat prevalent."
"I've Never Felt Threatened – Campus feels very safe to me, even when I am walking alone."
"Could Be Easier to Access – I have received financial aid from Kansas State very easily, however the scholarships are not made readily available to its students"
"Tons of Options in Aggieville! Aggieville is the business district directly across from KSU. Sandwhich shops, Wing places, Pizza places, Bars and many more are all located in this area. Costs are average...$8-$12 a meal. Many have student discounts. I love walking to Aggieville during my lunch break."
"I always find a computer, no matter how busy the library is, even during dead week. There are also computer areas in other places on campus, such as in the KSU Student Union. I don't even bring my laptop to campus. I just use one of K-State's computers."
"Very Strict About Academic Policies – KSU takes the honor code very seriously. That is a good thing! It's very dishonest and just irritating when people cheat. If someone is caught, it shows on their transcript forever."
"Many Places to Choose from – Many apartments and housing available. There are always people looking for roommates. Parking is mostly along the city streets. However, it may be tough to find a good apartment very close to campus because of higher costs and lower availability, so many students walk or ride their bikes from farther places. Most apartments cost around $400 including utilities. Cost is higher the closer they are to KSU. Manhattan is a generally safe city."
"Kansas State is great at standing out from other schools, many people who visit say how nice everyone that see on campus is, and how willing people are to help if a new freshman has a question about where to go for their classes. There are always things going on in Manhattan, although Aggieville is more fun if you're over 21!!"
"There is always something going on sports related, or greek related. There aren't as many options to do if you're not in one of those activities. There are still plenty of fun things, and then the library is very clean and usually quiet and a great place to study."
"The dorms are very clean and pretty spacious. I have gotten all of the smaller sized rooms and there was still plenty of room so that we were not cramped. I enjoy the dorm life and everyone hanging out in the lobbies, the people who clean the bathrooms are always nice too!"
"The student support is awesome, there is always a sea of purple!"
"Difficult, but Rewarding (Electrical Engineering) – As soon as you begin engineering, the workload hits you hard. Soon you learn to work in groups and become accustomed to the amount of time it takes. As far as job placement goes, engineers have an almost guaranteed placement after an undergraduate degree."
A Lot If You Hit the Marks – They give a guaranteed full ride for 32 ACT and/or top 10% of class.
"Kansas State has a very wide assortment of girls to choose from. Like the guys, they range from cowboy hats to as metro as they come. You won't see the former at KU."
"Big School, Small Town – Kansas State has every facility you'd possibly want at a university. On top of that, a renovation vision for 2025 will leave the university looking like the top school it really is."
"Lots of Drinking – In Aggieville especially, college kids really go nuts. There are tons of bars in a two block area and it is wild on Friday and Saturday ngihts. For kids that can't go to bars, lots of house parties near campus are in full swing."
"Acceptance Is Key – Any beliefs and background are accepted very quickly. Diversity is not perfect at KSU, but since they accept any type of person, then it is getting better."
"JUST WALK TO CLASS – Most college students shouldn't need to use their car for the entire semester except to go home. The campus is so close together, that walking and biking is perfect."
"Greeks Take Time – There are many different fraternaties and sororities at KSU, but if you ignore them, they can't help you. Take the time to see what they're all about."
"Best Campus Experience! After living in a college town for five years, I thought I knew what it would be like. After spending time at Kansas State University, I have redefined the college experience. It was the best years of my life so far."
"Very Good Dining – There are several off campus dining choices. Any kind of food you want, you can find it somewhere in Manhattan. Sadly, there are very few student discounts used by local businesses. despite this lack of discounts, there are several restaurants which provide excellent prices on meals."
"There are several clubs, organizations and classes pertaining to diversity. All races and genders are accepted, and I've seen a wide variety at the school. The school accepts many foreign exchange students which helps increase the diversity of students. There are many churches on and off campus of several religions, so religious practice is greatly accepted. I have seen however a lean towards Christianity. The sidewalks are often covered by religious slogans, practices and bible verses. This is not a problem though if you are accepting towards religions."
"I Wish I Had Chosen This Path Earlier – I started off as a Mechanical Engineering major, but I switched to a digital art major because this is what I really want to do. If I had started with this major, I would have taken the necessary courses to start out with and avoided the ones that I have difficulties in. Career wise, I would like to go into animation and graphic design. With the increasing amount of video game developers and movie production studios, I think that I won't have that much trouble finding a job."
"Sooo Good – The dining halls at Kansas State are fantastic. If you live in a dorm, there are passage ways and tunnels that lead directly to the dining halls, which is perfect for cold days. There are several different food lines open throughout the day. During breakfast, 'Classics' serves a different menu every day, however you have the option for a wide variety of cereals and yogurt. If you don't like anything they cook that morning, you have the option of making your own waffles or sandwiches. During lunch time, you always have the option for a burger, sub, or hotdog, But the 'Classics' line changes it's lunch menu daily as well. The dining hall offers a wide selection of salads, vegetables and fruit. During dinner, 'Classics' changes it's menu every night. The dining hall sometimes offers cultural meals and holiday meals to inform and serve fantastic food."
"In order to get into the digital art program at my school, it requires a lot of art courses before they allow you to get into the targeted art classes. A good thing is that the school has an easy class application process. Just a few online steps and you are enrolled in the class while the bill appears on another page to be paid later. The best advice I can give is to apply for classes early. The courses go fast and have long waiting lists."
"Internships? Where? Kansas State is a big school, and therefore has a lot of competition. Due to this increased amount of competition, internships are hard to find, and once one is found, it's hard to snag before someone else. I myself would love to have an internship. It would help me gain experience working in my field as well as help pay for the mounting bills. I unfortunately haven't located any professional training services either."
"Great Program – Kansas State University has a spectacular art program, however there are a few things that seem off. The school itself has a large amount of art students, however the problem is that there is only one art adviser for all the students. In order to talk with this adviser, one must make an appointment weeks in advance. This makes applying for next years courses to be very competitive due to the first come first serve aspect. The instructors for the art courses are actually art grad students, meaning that they can share their experiences in the classes and inform students on the lessons they learned. That is a good aspect that I enjoy. Overall a good program, with a lack of good administrative support."
"Its Alright. Dorm food is extremely overpriced and only marginal in quality. Everything else on campus is fast food, so good luck finding something cheap and healthy!"
"Lots of Variation – Midwestern weather varies a lot... If you can withstand -20 degree winter with 5 feet of snow, to 115 degree humid heat summers, i'm sure you'll be ok."
"Social Exception – I'm not social, and everything on campus is social, so i assume it's awesome but i'm not the one to ask."
"The facilities at KSU are not the newest or modern in the Midwest, but they serve their purpose well and do not really lack anything."
Guys and Girls at KSU – I love the people here. There are a lot of good looking people and a wide range of different ethnicities for all peoples tastes.
Everyone who wants to live in the dorms or campus apartments usually gets what they want.
"KSU FASFA – I didn't qualify for any grants because my parents make too much money, but I do not receive any money from my parents so I need financial aid."
"Down in the Ville – Just south of KSU campus is a 2 block by 2 block area known as Aggieville. There are many options, and usually anyone can find a restaurant that fits their tastes. Some of the healthier options include Pita pit, Subway, and Mr. Goodcents. In a hurry? Don't worry, there's a few places you can hit in a rush. My new favorite is the Cozy Inn Hamburger, a small shop where you can buy burgers by the bag, quickly, and late at night. Also, the area as plenty of sit down restaurants and many bar and grill restaurants."
"You wil find someone that loves what you love in a heartbeat. Its like American ""Melting Pot"" except most of the girls are gorgeous."
"You Should Have a Car – Having a car is very nice if you don't want to be on campus a lot, but there are so many things join on on campus so you don't really need a car unless you want to out to eat."
Nicest Place on the Planet! Everyone at K-STATE is so nice. Everyone there knows manners. You can't beat AGGIEVILLE!
"Extreme Seasons – It snows a lot in the winter and its humid in the summer, but it personally doesn't effect me that much."
"Couldn't Be Better – Couldn't be better, there are computers everywhere"
"I definitely feel safe on campus but when coming to the outer edges of campus, things seem to feel a little less safe. There has also been more incidents that happen in those areas. A good number of students live right on the edges of campus and are out at the library, studio or for sports after dark so it's hard to feel safe at those times."
"I feel like everyone, whether they are into sports or not interested, has been to at least one game because they are so much fun. The only reason I wouldn't give them an A+ however, is they don't do a great job of getting students involved. I wouldn't know about many of the club or intramural teams we have if it wasn't for upper-year friends that have told me about them. That would benefit greatly if they promoted those opportunities better!"
Great Choice for Me – Kansas State is a great place to be. I love it here...the teachers are awesome and really care about their students. You just have to be willing to ask for help. Great local community and lots of opportunities for students to volunteer in the community. I am glad I picked Kansas State University!
Just Use Your Head – I am very careful not to work alone after night classes. I always had my brother or boyfriend pick me up after class. You just can not be to safe. There have been incidents and I am just careful about those things. Overall if you need to help campus security will escort you and the university tries to keep their students safe. The worst thing that has happened to me is someone floured all the cars on my block.. annoying but didn't really hurt anyone.
I Stay Away – I do not know anyone who uses drugs. Drinking is more prevalent. But once I moved out of the dorms into my own apartment I am not really affected by any of this. My friends study hard and work hard to make good grades. I rarely go to parties and when I do people are cool if I do not drink.
"The financial aid process should be smoother, i had to fill out several forms! also, they just don't have enough for the students who really need it!"
"the off campus housing has a lot of options around town, whether you want apartments or houses, pricing is reasonable!"
"Freshman Parking honestly sucks, because you have to park in the farthest lots, R and Z. Also, if you get a ticket, you have to pay it in about 2 weeks or you get fined more. The parking permits are also kind of expensive."
"Campus Police, Academic Warning – The campus police are strict, but they also understand that we are college students. The college is also really strict on academic warning, so make sure you keep on top of your classes and their grades!"
"The parking on campus is very limited and very confusing due to the fact that purchasing a parking pass does not allow students to park just anywhere. The parking lots are specifically designated, and not large enough to accommodate the amount of parking passes purchased. Though parking on campus is very limited, there are many places to park off campus. Parking enforcement is very diligent in making sure all traffic and parking rules are enforced, and more than likely you will get a ticket if a rule is broken."
"Emphasis on Group Work – One of the very unique aspects about the College of Education at Kansas State University is the emphasis placed on teamwork. At the beginning of the semester, students are placed in a group of 3-5 students with whom throughout the semester as a group, projects and discussions will take place within this group. All of the instructors of the program have worked first hand in classrooms from very diverse backgrounds ranging from suburban, urban, and rural schools; in which gives students very diverse perspectives on various situations."
"School Observations – Prior to being accepted into the School of Education, all education majors are placed into a local middle or high school to observe a teacher for an entire semester. The duties that are to be performed during the observation period range very widely (grading papers, leading small group discussions, and other small tasks). The program is a way to expose students into the classroom atmosphere so the student can determine if education is a degree that the student would like to pursue."
"No Surprises – One things I appreciate about the Secondary Education program at K-State were that there were no surprised about what is expected from their students. The academic advisors for the School of Education, work closely with students to inform them of all the necessary steps in order to obtain admission and their are many classes offered prior to acceptance to the School of Education that informs students of what is to come. My only complaint is that some of the required pre-requisite programs are 0-1 credit hours, and the requirements for the classes are very high."
"The process of getting into the Secondary education major required a lot of outside work, but the process was completely reasonable. There were multiple components that went into the selection process of the major including academics, community service, and professionalism. Before any student is selected into the program a GPA of 2.5 is the minimum requirement, a total of 20 community service hours were to be performed, and lastly a minimum of 20 hours were to be spent in a professional classroom setting."
"Engineering has always been something that I was interested in since my sophomore year of high school, so going into Chemical Engineering was a no brainer for me. I know I made the right choice when choosing to go into engineering. My career goals is to work with Dow Chemical or Honeywell as a chemical engineering in Germany. I am not that concerned with finding a job within my field, engineerings are always needed and this program has prepared me to be able to function in the work setting."
"Challenging but Rewarding – It is no secret that K-State is known for their Engineering and Agriculture departments. Being an engineer has been difficult but their has always been somebody their to help, including but not limited to instructors, tutors and fellow classmates. Sometimes the advisors may seem insensitive especially when in the intro classes but overall the program has definitely had more pros and than cons and I feel that by the time I graduate I will be well prepared to go out into the work field."
"Constant Hassel – I received financial aid, but it is a pain! The FASFA itself is not difficult to get, but putting the information through K-State is challenging. It is very repetitive and the information they ask for seems very unnecessary."
"AggieVille is a great place right by campus for shopping, eating out, etc. The only problem is that bars dominate the small section of Manhattan. And many times coupons are lacking in this area of the community for students. So if you are not willing to drive or bike a distance elsewhere in Manhattan, you are limited in choices. BUT that's not to say there aren't some ""college friendly"" expense places, or that it doesn't offer anything great!"
The library is huge and has books ranging just about any topic you could imagine.
"The parking at Kansas State University is plentiful. I never have to worry about finding a parking space even on busy days, such as transfer visit days and the such."
"I am not 21 yet, and won't be for most of my stay at this university, so I don't really know what the nightlife is like. I spend most of my nights sleeping."
Transferring to Kansas State University is simple to do and there are several scholarships that all transfer students are eligible for. Most of the credits from in-state schools will transfer flawlessly: especially if you are transferring with a 2-year degree. The staff at the university make the whole transfer a lot easier than the rumors of transferring have made it sound.
"Not Really Teachers.. Teachers don't know how to teach. Are smart, but.."
"Lots of variety for both sexes, I believe there is almost a 1:1 ratio of female:men."
The sports are incredible at K-State. The games are almost always fun to watch. Every game includes the Wabash Cannonball. EMAW.
"Derby Dining – Here at Derby we have many lines to choose from such as pizza, pasta, hamburgers, sandwiches, and our classic line. We also have a salad bar which is really good! For dessert we have many desserts to choose from, the ice cream we have is the best since its from Call Hall."
"Always Booming. You can find someone partying every day/night of the week. Aggieville is usually pretty fun, but if you are under 21 you definitely need to be involved or know someone that is involved in Greek Life, because the fraternity's have the best parties and they don't usually get busted."
"Since it is such a large school, there are a wide variety of people here: guys and girls. But their attitude's are all very similar. People here like to party and very few want to settle down and get focused."
"Im from the midwest anyways, so the bi-polar weather doesnt bother me much during the seasons."
"In the athletic training program, you immediately start learning the tools of the trade and skills that you will actually use in the field."
I didnt have any difficulties receiving my financial aid from the university.
I Feel That K-state offers a quality education in multiple programs. There are multiple opportunities to succeed at this institution.
I dont feel unsafe on campus. Campus police are always doing rounds around campus.
It Is Good – There need to be different dorms for people trying to actually try in school. In the room next to me the person plays guitar all night long and it is impossible to sleep.
"It Is Kansas – It is always changing, but this year the winter was warm."
It Was Good – If you did not know what you were doing they could help you. But they did not allow some methods of payment.
"There's no visible public transportation in the city of Manhattan. There may be some small bus routes that I'm not aware of and there is a bus for disabled students on campus, but basically all students walk, ride a bike, or drive to classes and elsewhere around the city. It's definitely not hard to get around town though."
"GUYS AND GIRLS – Variety of people, every school has ""that"" guy or girl"
"NOT 21 – If youre not 21, its boring, Its all about the night life here. AGGIEVILLE"
"This is a great place to live, very safe environment & fun things to do."
"The facilities are great, clean, modern & up to date."
"Great Place to Live! I believe living in the residence halls is such a good experience I became a tour guide to show incoming freshmen how they work. The rooms are clean with their own heating/AC. Most are double-occupancy (two roommates, community bathroom shared with the rest of the wing), but singles and suites with their own bathrooms are available. The bathrooms are cleaned every day at a certain time. It varies per floor, and the only real problem is sometimes they are late getting to it and a different floor's bathroom must be used. If there is a problem with a roommate, K-State is wonderful about reworking assignments. There are a million floor opportunities, including a set time for all residents of the floor to eat dinner together to avoid the high school ""where do I sit"" problem. The dining halls are rated 15th in the nation by the Princeton Review. The halls also compete against each other in events like the All-Hall Volleyball Brawl. Most res halls are coed, but there are two available all-female dorms. There are all-male floors within the coed halls, but it depends on enrollment. The newest halls are in Derby complex, the halls nearest to the rec are in Kramer, and the old-fashioned ""hotelish"" halls are in Van Zile. Sophomores and older are also offered the opportunity to move to Jardine complex, on-campus apartment-style living."
"Safe and Secure – K-State has wonderful campus security. There are emergency phones with very visible blue lights all over campus. The police can be seen every day, just checking up on things. They also drop in on the residence hall lobbies during the night. Most of the time, we don't even lock our room doors. They also offer a free program called Wildcat Walk, where someone from the security staff will walk with a student anywhere on campus in order to make sure they come home safely."
"Lots of Places. Dorms are great and you meet a lot of people. Apartments the nicest, but you don't meet as many people and you have a lot of the same rules the dorms have. Houses can get pretty dirty, but they're cheap and you don't have many rules."
"Lovin' It – The dorms are great. Right now I'm living in Haymaker and my floor is great. We are always doing things together like bowling, playing music, doing homework, or going on road trips. The dorms or a fraternity or sorority are a must, just to get yourself out there. I meet new, awesome people all the time. The cost isn't too bad for the dorms themselves and having a public bathroom is not nearly as bad as it seems. The Derby dining complex is connected to 4 of the dorms so you don't have to go outside to eat. There is always lots of great choices for food at the Derb."
"There's Always at Least One Out There – There are tons of computers on campus; in the libraries, in different buildings, in the dorms. If one place is crowded, there is always somewhere else you can go. You also get $10 of free printing every semester which is nice."
"Architectural Engineering – The program for Architectural Engineering at Kansas University is rigorous yet very rewarding. You are able to take classes from a variety of majors, including civil, mechanical, electrical, and architectural engineering as well as construction management and others. The workload can be overwhelming at times, but is also very manageable. The engineering facilities are the nicest on campus. Newer buildings with more resources, such as computer labs, provide plenty of locations and opportunities to study, with or without friends."
"Getting Money – KSU offers great shcolarships directly out of highschool, but after that it takes your own time and searching to find private scholarships. The one I currently hold is for orchestra. I had one freshman year that was due to my HS GPA, but it is good to go into college not counting ONLY on the college's scholarships, but that you will have to do work to earn funds."
"The Fans! Unlike many schools, we have a designated student section right on the 50-yard line for football games, and at half court for basketball games. Student Government has ensured this section just for students and it is truly a privelege. The spirit of the fans is amazing as well! After a win, the walls of my room can't keep out the screams from fans."
"KSU Wireless – The wireless is available everywhere, even a little distance away from campus, but it can come and go at times. That is not good for when you really need it. However, all the local coffee shops always have free wireless available."
"Student Teaching – I won't have an internship, but as an Early Childhood Education major, I will start student teaching next year. I am not sure yet what my responsibilities will be, but it will be unpaid and difficult. K-State is great with providing student teaching positions, so I am not worried about starting it.I have been able to already volunteer at a few places, to prepare me for student teaching."
"Drinking Is Big, Not Overwhelming – Drinking is fairly big on weekends, but most people keep it at house parties or in bars. Drug use is low, though you can find it if you're looking, it depends who you hang out with. Even if they are doing drugs, it's usually no worse than marijuana."
"Almost Always Helpful – Kansas State University has been an amazing experience. The professors are almost always available to help, but there are quite a few from another country which makes it difficult to understand them. The campus, buildings included, is beautiful and convenient. Class participation is important in most of the classes, large lecture classes included."
"At KSU Ever Man Truly Is a Wildcat – KSU is a great University to be a part of. There are so many ways to get involved, the staff and faculty are awesome at helping you reach your goals, and the education is amazing. Not only do we work hard, but we also have fun. Football games are awesome to attend and the school pride is truly something to be hold."
"Greek life is a huge part of campus. They do several activities and events for the campus and community. It is a great way to get involved and to become part of a family. However, they each greek house is extremely competitive with other houses, and can sometimes cause problems with meshing together."
"KSU has a great diversity on and off campus. Not only does KSU make up a wide range of different races and religions, but it also proudly supports military students. The campus and town are very accepting, and you feel as if you are in a big town with lots of fun things to do, but you still get that small town feel."
"Good Stuff – At K-State, there are many different great places to eat. Of course you have your regular places like Arby's, McDonald's, and Sonic, but there are many other cool places to eat and many discounts too. Aggieville is full of life at anytime, day or night. Lots of great food. Try AJ's pizzeria or So Long Saloon. Lot's of asian restaurants too."
there weather isn't really bad here. they always clean off the sidewalks when it snows and all the buildings are really close so no problem
the food isn't that great and there is always the same thing for lunch. the dinner choices aren't that great too. they will have weird stuff that they make for food here.
"Peel Off the Layers – Personally, I do not see diversity as skin color, but by background. We have those students from huge cities to the smallest of towns. We represent all 50 states, 100's of countries and many religions. If you look for diversity you will find it here if you peel back the layers of those around you."
Very Few Drugs Here – There is not much drug useage on campus accept that it is very popular to go visit the bars on Fridays by many students to have a drink.
Club Sport Are Very Popular Here – Our school has a wide verity of club sports as well as school sports. Our athletics seem to enjoy their sports very well and have a lot of fun doing it. Football is very popular here.
"Students Open and Friendly. The students are very open. It is common for students to wear clothes that are comfortable and socially acceptable, however, they are open to students' who wear nontraditional clothes like a Halloween costume or religious based clothing. All in All, a very welcoming college."
"Experience the KSU Lifestyle – The KSU campus has a lot to offer its students for entertainment. There are tons of dining facilities, a large union for students to gather and fellowship, multiple workout facilities, and plenty of hide-away areas for students to study, do homework or sleep:)"
"Go Cats! Manhattan, KS is the hometown of the infamous KSU Wildcats. Although it's a small town, Manhattan is well-known for the KSU campus, K-State games, and the party place Aggieville. If you ever visit the ""Little Apple,"" be sure not to wear anything from the rival campus KU, because in Manhattan, the Wildcats RULE. GO CATS!!"
Surprisingly Tasty – Most people hate the taste of cafeteria food but at least in my dining hall the food is great and you get as much as you want. there are tons of options for whatever your hankering is.
School Spirit – I have seen very few schools have as much school spirit as Kansas State University has. I personally plan on joining their dance team. It is truly amazing. Everyone dresses up and it is like a community. Sports are a pretty huge deal here.
"Many of the off-campus apartments are kind of expensive. Luckily I was able to find one that included a good amount of utilities but it still comes to just over 1,000 a month. There are others in the area farther from campus (by just a few blocks) that do cost as low as $711 to about $950 a month but 90% of them are closer to the latter and they don't include as much as my apartment does. I am signing the lease at University Crossing in Manhattan, Kansas. It's not perfect but it is pretty close as far as I can see. The cost is expensive but it makes better sense to spend $1,000 a month with most utilities included than it does to spend $900 a month with nothing included. Overall I give this high price a C+"
I am constantly being surprised by the amount of diversity on our campus. Although we have a majority of white students we also have many international students as well. We have a great deal of diversity in other areas as well.
"A Lot of Variety – Kansas State University has a variety of different courses to take and majors to major in. There is also a veterinary school here which is the main reason I chose to go here. There are a lot of different clubs and sororities and fraternities to join. It is very easy to get involved here. There are also a lot of sports you can try out for and many intramural sports you can participate in. There is little limitation to the recreational activities you can do here. There is also a place real close to campus called, ""Aggieville."" There are some great restaurants and bars there. That is where most of the students go to hang out on weekends."
"Very Safe – I always feel safe at Kansas State University. I have never felt threatened. The community here is great. The people are very nice, helpful, and friendly. I haven't heard anything about a campus crime. We do have a lot of campus security which helps add to the safe environment."
"Secondary Ed as a Nontraditional Student – I am a nontraditional student in secondary education at Kansas State University. I love this university!! The classes are demanding, but necessary to set you up for success upon graduation. The offerings for additional certificates along with your degree are immense. I plan on obtaining an ESL certification and a provisional license in special education. The instructors and professors are usually more than willing to help their students. Most classes are large, but the instructors understand this and always ask if clarification is necessary."
"There are many types of students at the school, all pursuing their future to the best of their ability."
"This year has been a mild weather year. I come from a colder climate, so it is nice for me."
It's worth it getting the student season tickets. The University gives away a lot of freebies and the teams are fun to watch.
"Being an out of state student, my experience at K-State has varied from others. I have had an incredibly wonderful experience at K-State so far. I have found my niche in journalism by working for the Kansas State Collegian. I have also picked up another job writing about equality for the National Equity Assistance Center. I have crossed into Gamma Rho Lambda, and I couldn't be happier with that decision. I have gotten involved with the African American leaders at K-State who are changing the dynamics here. I am incredibly proud to be able to get to know these students while they are here. I am so proud to be a wildcat."
"With Fake Patty's Day vastly approaching, the campus has become more strict with this particular event. It is unfortunate that every dorm building is completely shutting down and the only way people will be able to get back into the buildings is to swipe your card into the front entrance, which is not normally the case. But when large events like this are not happening at K-State or surrounding communities, the strictness is not relevant at all. Kansas State University trusts the students on and off campus. They expect a certain level of responsibility from the students who attend the university, since we are all in college. We are adults, and usually, the university treats us accordingly."
"There are some negative issues face the Greek community at K-State. But overall, the Greek life has a positive impact on the general community. When you attend K-State, one out of every three students participate in Greek life, whether it is through a traditional house, the Divine Nine, a progressive sorority or fraternity or an academic fraternity. It has been a wonderful experience for me rushing and crossing into Gamma Rho Lambda. The K-State campus often unknown to our particular house, but being a member has made me more confident and happier with the life I have on campus."
"Drinking Is Mostly What I See – At K-State, I haven't seen a whole lot of drug usage at all besides drinking. I guess it depends on who your friends are though."
Safe for the Most Part. I feel very safe on campus but feel uneasy walking alone at night. Make sure to keep your doors locked.
Parking is honestly inconvenient. A parking garage was recently built but it's on the opposite side of campus from the dorms and the parking situation near the dorms is inconvenient. It's a long walk and almost impossible to find a parking space. Not a fan.
"SO Good – I LOVE the places to eat off campus, so much that my freshman year I found myself trying to convince myself it was a good idea to not eat my pre-paid meals provided on my meal plan and pay out of pocket for some Subway or So Long Saloon. If you live on campus Aggieville dining is relatively easy to get to and there are many coupons available for students at many places available."
"Love It, Just More Healthy Food – Honestly I love the dining available at KSU, I just wish there were more healthy options. There's recently been additions such as coffee shops and there's Quik Cats if you ever need a snack, but I know other schools in the Kansas area offer hummus and pita as a grab-n-go type of meal and I think I could really benefit from that. Overall the food available at K-State is enjoyable."
There are lots of fast healthy places right on campus
It's great there are security stations at all locations around campus
Drinking Is Big – It's a college town. Aggieville is right across from campus and is where all the bars are and it gets crazy on the weekends.
"Football Games Are a Blast – And so are the basketball games. Students are flustered with what we like to call 'Purple Pride.' Our teams are decent considering we're in the big 12, but they keeps us entertained."
"A Lot of Variety – At k-state, there are many fine attractive woman and handsome men. Girls usually wear tights, some men are country boys, but there are many people with the good looks here in this small college"
Safe Ride Is Best – One of the main transportation system at Kansas University is the Safe Ride program that picks up and drops off many places around campus and is completley free. Safe Ride runs till three in the morning eaveryday.
Diverse Community – On the Kansas State University campus there is a wide variety of people the roam on campus all with very diverse lifestyles. I believe that there is a very good exchange program and many students are brought from foriegn countries. Everybody that is from Manhattan Kansas is very excepting of the diverse culture that is brought in to the University.
Great Living – The living oppertunities on campus are seemingly endless. There are many dorm complexes to choose from. Accesability to all classes on campus is exceedingly great.
It snowed last week and a few days later it was 50 degrees outside. So it's pretty unpredictable.
Chill and Safe – Pretty lax atmosphere on campus near buildings and campus is safe.
"Comfortably Close – Manhattan is a decent sized town with some of the nicest people you will meet. It has a small mall, and the two main attraction streets are Poyntz and Aggieville. The schools nearby are Manhattan Christian College and the Univeristy of Kansas, our rival, is about an hour away."
"I am from out of state and the cost of tuition is pretty big but they gave me a scholarship for good grades in high school that came pretty close to in state tuition. You really have to search for scholarships, they won't fall in your lap."
There are a lot of foreign exchange students from all of the countries in Asia but other than that campus is not very diverse. It is a mainly white campus.
"Derby Dining Center – I think ""the derb"", as we call it, is really good for cafeteria food. They always have a deli, italian, and mexican option for all meals with Classics changing everyday. Classics are the types of food your mom would make you, like mac and cheese and chicken fingers on good days. I think they have a very healthy food selections. Also they have a salad bar and desert bar."
"Pretty Safe – Although there have some instances of rape here on k-state campus, I feel relatively safe walking the campus. K-state provides lighted paths for those who are walking the campus late at night with built in security features that allow you to push a button and the lights turn blue alerting the campus police. Along with that is the option to call and request someone escort you around campus if you're wary of walking alone late at night. Also, for those who like to party and your friends do too, hence leaving you without a responsible designated driver, k-state provides free transportation on the weekends to take you from wherever you are back to your dorm safe and sound."
Dorms have a friendly atmosphere. Plenty of things to do.
"The facilities range from very new to very old. Outside appearance is nice, but some insides of buildings need to be updated."
"Dorm Life Is the Best – The dorm life is great, the Ra's are helpful. The cost seems high, but when you compare it to other schools, its really about the same."
"Food Is Good – The dining hall food is good, but I don't eat breakfast so not sure about that. Make sure you use all the meals in your plan each week, cause its use it or lose it"
"Not Haveing Been in School for Awhile,Got in on a GED – The Hardest thing for me was haveing to take Gen Ed courses,like English,Math,Psychology,"
"There Are Not Enough Places to Park,Due to the Amount of Students Takeing Classes – Some Days there are alot of students in class so parking spots are all taken.along with non students parking in them also"
"Shopping,Fast Food – There is so much shopping in our town not enough people to live here to spend that much time shopping ,Also there are to many Fast food places in town."
"Process Could Have Been Smoother – I received a decent amount of financial aid, but it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. A couple of my forms got lost in the shuffle, so I had to stay on top of things. I suggest making regular in-person appointments with your financial aid officer to make sure things are going smoothly."
"I'm Not Really Sure – I am not really into the party scene so I'm not the best reference on this, but based on the amount of drunken idiots I see stumbling through aggieville I'd guess it's pretty good."
The quality of academics at Kansas State is very high. They have several national award winning professors. They are very warm and friendly and always available to help.
The off campus dining is typical for a community the size of Manhattan. They have all the chain restaurants plus a few really unique places when you want to get away from dorm food.
"Just Starting – I'm majoring in Event Managememet which is a relatively new offering. The advisors have been great, with a focus on both the present and the future. The instructors are excellent, and I find that I am able to get any extra help that I have needed."
"Average, but Controlled – K-State has a NO TOLERANCE policy for illegal and illicit drug activity on campus. Though you can find a few vagabonds who will ignore the policy, if you ever get caught, you get kicked out, NO EXCEPTION. There are no qualms about it and they keep it very quiet. Alcohol is a different story. Most people at K-State have used or seen the use of alcohol even though the University has a policy against it unless you are of age. Even so, in the dorms, you must be 21 to have it in the room and are only allowed two 24-packs of beer with only one allowed to be open at a time. Most people will not pressure you to drink, but some will so watch who you hang out with. And that policy is pretty strongly enforced. If you get caught, you will face the consequences, whatever they may be."
"Very Diverse, Mostly Accepting. Diversity on campus is GREAT! K-State has representation from pretty much any and every socioeconomic, ethnic, racial, political, and religious group you could think of. We also have a very strong presence of LGBT students. Our campus puts a very strong focus on acceptance of all students, no matter the situation. We have a strict NO TOLERANCE policy for mistreatment of students based on any of the above listed factors. Most students accept one another, but there are still a very FEW ignorant souls who cannot be helped. Overall, K-State is a wonderful place for diversity."
"Wonderful, Helpful, Friendly Campus and Classes – The academics at K-State are far above standard. The faculty is very helpful, the student body is friendly and the campus atmosphere is great! I chose K-State because my major program of study is not offered anywhere else and therefore K-State is the best option for this. The Department of Grain Science faculty is wonderful and will help students that need it. You need never be afraid to reach out for extra help. The classes vary in size, but most professors have no problem helping you if you need it."
"SO MANY GREEKS – It may be because I live in an area surrounded by fraternities, but I always seem to see Greek students everywhere. My classes are filled with students showing off their letters, and people walking to class talking about frat parties. I have no problems with Greeks, except when the neighboring fraternities have parties on weeknights."
"No Reason to Search – I had no reason to search very hard for off-campus living. I decided I would be living at K-State Wesley when I was still in high school, so I never had to look around at apartments. I still live off-campus, but close enough to campus that everything is easily accessible."
"Ticketing and Fines – Tickets honestly aren't that bad on campus. It's $10 for a ticket in a meter, and $25 for tickets elsewhere. Just be careful about what time / place you park."
Animal Science/Pre-Vet – To be Animal Science/Pre-vet major can be challenging at time but that is what you should expect if you are going into Pre-vet. I love my program it offers a lot of different class and you have the ones you are required to take but you also have a lot of hours where you can choose to take whatever class you want to. I love all the teacher I have had to far. They make even a hard class enjoyable and easy to understand. You are not required to do an internship but it very much encouraged. You are also encouraged to study abroad. There are lots of opportunities to study abroad and they are willing to help you pay for it even.
Greaat School With Awsome Atmosphere. I love K-State. It has a great atmosphere and you feel like you part of a big family. The campus is fairly big but you still run into people you know all the time on the to and from class. Even if you have a big lecture class your teachers are very willing to meet with you and help you if you feel like you need it.
"A Wide Variety of Places. There are a wide variety of excellent food place to eat. There are are quite a few place to eat very close to campus such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Chipotle, Coco Bolos, and many more."
HR Managment – I have been very satisfied with my education in HR mannagment
"Cars Are Handy but Not Necessary. It's convenient to have a car but not necessary. You can walk anywhere on campus and there's a lot to do in Aggieville which is also in walking distance. To go shopping you'd need a ride, but people are nice about helping each other out with rides. I recommend bringing a bicycle. Our campus also has a safe ride system if you need a ride home on the weekends."
Careful Where You Park! Parking on campus is very crowded and if you park somewhere without the proper permit you'll get a ticket! There isn't a curfew and it's common to go out late at night. As long as you aren't drinking recklessly you probably won't get caught or get in trouble. Just make smart decisions.
"The most computers available for student use are at the library, but most of them are taken on a regular basis. Macs and PCs are available. Every student gets $10 of printing on their ID at the beginning of each semester. The housing network is slow in the dorms, but wifi is available around campus. You should have your own laptop."
Kstate's Edge – The edge that Kansas State has over other schools is its accessibility and diversity. Most people can find precisely what they are looking for by way of experience and degree when going to Kansas State.
"Most People Use Alcohol – Although there are some students who use drugs (primarily marijuana) most students drink if anything. I believe most students use their involvement in scholastic activities as their motivation to avoid drugs, alcohol on the other hand is easier to hide."
The diversity on campus at the University of Kansas is definitely something to be spoken of. There are students who come from every walk of life and the demographics of originating geographic locations is astounding. There is ample variation in topics such as religions and ethnic backgrounds. I have been truly amazed at the diversity on campus.
The weather on campus isn't as bad as i expected it to be and from what i have heard from other students on campus that i it gets pretty bad in the winter and its been pretty good so far.
Parking on campus can be hard and expecially when you cant find a parking spot in your section and then when you go and park into anoter section you get a parking ticket and in some areas of parking are so small that your car can't fit.
Campus Policies – Kansas state university policies for there campus is ok but when you need to talk with your teacher about something that is very important sometimes its hard to her something back for them.
"I Wouldn't Choose Anywhere Else to Go – Whether you are just going to college at K-state for the academics or social life you will not be disappointed. Overall, the environment at K-state is better than any other college that I have visited!"
"Lots of People, Nice People – With over 20,000 people on campus, you can always find someone to look at. Everyone is nice here, I have not yet met a person that has been outwardly mean to me or anyone else."
"Availability and Quality. The availability of food across campus is exceptional. I have never been disappointed by a meal at any location on campus as of yet. While it may not be restaurant quality all the time, it definitely is great for college students on a budget!"
"Lots of Options – Campus is conveniently located and designed, making it easy to walk or bike wherever you need to go. There is also a bus that makes a few rounds, but doesn't seem to be used often."
"Excellent Dining Opportunity – The Student Union offers a wide variety of restaurants at a convenient mid campus location. The atmosphere is clean and cozy, and the prices are reasonable. Having so many dining options is wonderful if you spend a lot of time on campus."
"Kansas State Housing Off-Campus – I still life on campus. Therefore, I don't have a very good idea of how the off-campus housing options are. However, I know several people who live off campus and they say that it is pretty affordable and within a good distance for campus. I hear that the Jardine complex is affordable and is still considered on campus."
"Sports Are the Best – Sports at K-State are incredibly fun! We are not always the best team but every K-State team is improving and qualifying for tournaments and bowl games. When you go to any K-State football game you are there with 50,000 of your closest friends and family. The same is true for every other sport including women's basketball, volleyball and track. Students at K-State support every sport."
Chains and Local – There are a lot of places around campus. Tons of fast food chains mixed in with local favorites. The dining halls are incredible and so worth the price that you pay.
"School Spirit Is What It Is All About! Manhattan is very much a college town. Everyone is there to support the school athletically and academically. There are a lot of fun things to do but you have to find them with your friends. There is a movie theater, a mall, many restaurants, and always a fun event on campus!"
Deliveries Are Everything. And You Have Books of Coupons On good Deals.!
It's Ok – The Greek system at my school is ok I guess. Sometimes it can be annoying having to walk or drive by one of their crazy parties.
"As a member of the KSU Marching Band, I have really enjoyed playing in pep rallies and games. Our team has had a great season and the fans give support to the football team as well as the band. It's a wonderful feeling to be part of such a large support system."
I have not had to use the university computers that much this semester. Many of my friends have and are satisfied with the results.
There are plenty of options available at various locations and the prices are extremely reasonable
Great Learning Experience – Kansas State University is great when it comes to learning experience. There are plenty girls and boys around to get to know. It's a fun place to learn and meet people!
"Great learning experience, but not so great off campus activities. Bars, clubs, school groups, but not a large amount."
"Thoughts Are Changing – In high school, I'd always had the thought that I wanted to be a veterinarian when I grew up. When I got to college, everything changed. I decided that I still wanted to work with animals, but being a vet may not be exactly what I wanted to do. I decided to try out psychology. The professors and advisors at K-State are very helpful in helping me to decide what it is I want to do for the rest of my life, and if I had the chance, despite the fact that I wouldn't know what I'd want to do for the longest time, I'd be glad to do it all over again."
"In Kansas, the running joke is that if you don't like the weather, wait around because it's likely to change within the next five minutes. For the most part, we have beautiful weather. It may be cold and blustery, but the sun usually shines. We do have the occasional storm, but it's usually not an every day occurrence. During the winter, we have chances of snow. We've learned to just deal with whatever the day brings and how it brings it to us."
"We Have the Best Fans – At Kansas State, whether it's cheering on our football team to a Bowl Game or screaming our heads off for our basketball team, we have the best student section anyone could ask for. The seats are always filled and the band is always in tow, and when you have that combination, you're asking for an amazing game! Setting high goals for ourselves at KSU, we usually come back winners or at least in the top ranks of who we go up against. And if it's more intramural sports you're looking to play and cheer for, we have those, too! It's super easy to sign up for a sport and play with or against your friends. K-State sports is definitely something to be a part of!"
Love My School – My experience at KSU was greatly influenced by the faculty and staff. They were very personable and available.
By permit there is campus parking...campus also has meters
I was a non traditional student so I didn't go to many parties or clubs. Rusty's is the most popular bar. Many of the fraternities and sororities host parties throughout the year.
I lived off campus my entire time as a student I never felt unsafe or had any issues? On occasion I heard of people getting mugged or fights in the club sector.
"Shuttles Are Good Alternative – There is a lot of campus parking, but spots fill up quickly. We recently had a parking garage built, and this created more space. There is also a shuttle that runs from the middle of campus to other areas of town such as apartment complexes that make it easier for kids to go back and forth freely if they do not have transportation."
"Middle of Town Spots – Our town has a section of bars and restaurants that are available for families and friends during the day, and for the college scene at night. Certain places are open for minors and some are 21 and older. This is a diverse place full of a variety of foods and hangout spots. There is also a transportation service that goes about town from the bar area and to campus, making sure this is a safe environment."
"The athletic center is a big part of campus, and the rec complex is a very popular place for students to work out as well as play their favorite sports when they have time. The library is also a heavily trafficked area in the middle of campus, and allow for a place to study and do assignments with classmates."
"Great School for Learning and Fun – I absolutely love this school. You will meet a lot of great people, have fun at sporting events, and learn a lot. It is one of the best school choices. It is an awesome school."
"Very Quick and Easy – There are a few places to get a shuttle to campus. It doesn't cost much, but it is very close to campus. Most people live very close so they just walk."
Instant Use of the System – They have a lot of computers in the library and the labs available to people at all times. I have no problem ever getting on a computer when I need it. The wifi is really quick and not usually slow at all.
People on Campus – People on my campus are friendly. There are a lot of events on campus that let us interact with one another.
"Dorm Life – Living on campus at KSU has its pros and cons. Since the dorms are in the middle of campus it only takes 10 minutes or less to get to class and you don't have to waste gas. Also, the dining service is great. A lot of variety in food choices. Disadvantage is the roommate situation. The rooms aren't the biggest and if you get put with someone random it could end up being a hassle."
"There are a lot of different option in the town of Manhattan. Also, not only are the places yummy, they are healthy."
"Easy Application Process – Most students as freshman fill out a general scholarship form for the university, and from that the school doles out all of their general scholarships. If you can get a 32 or more on your ACT, you will receive full tuition for your years at college based on the Putnam scholarship. You can also try to maintain a high GPA. Be sure to apply for scholarships to your specific college within the University also!"
"In the fall it will be very hot, and getting to classes far across campus can sometimes be sweaty. In the winter, it will be very cold. Kansas has the extremes so this should be expected. As a Kansas resident all my life, I'm used to it so it doesn't really affect my experience."
"Good Luck – Parking at K-State is poor. The parking garage has limited spots for students with permits. Once those spots are taken, you have to pay. Other parking lots fill up early."
"There are few crimes in Manhattan. Overall, campus is well lit and safe at night."
Manhattan has a small town family feel. The city revolves around K-State and its sports teams.
I Would Have Liked More Options – I received most of my financial aid through FAFSA. I only received two scholarsips from the school and they were small but helpful. I wish there were more options available to average students because I felt like if you weren't a minority or an exemplary student then you didn't have much of a chance to get financial aid.
"There are lots of people you see around campus who are in a sorority or a fraternity. However it's not like you have to be in greek life to meet people. It may be easier, but you can still meet tons of people around campus. They are still friendly and not exclusive to people who are in their chapter. There are also lots of options for those who want to join a frat or a sorority. Anyone can find a place to fit in."
"You Won't Find Two People Who Are the Same – There are alot of different types of people on campus. You'll see alot of country boys with the boots,hats and trucks, but there is also alot of variety. The girls are all different too. The majority of girls are in sororitys but you can still find someone to be friends with if you aren't in a sorority."
"EMAW- Every Man's a Wildcat. Being at this school really makes you proud and have school spirit. The campus is beautiful, the atmosphere is just great, I would definitely choose K-State because the school and the city is just a great place to be in."
"Girls here are generally pretty attractive. You would notice that a huge population of them are in sororities, which means they can handle responsibility and can have fun at the same time. Girls here are also very friendly and that's a major plus to this university."
"There are many delivery options when it comes to eating off campus. It differs from pizza, to chinese food, or just a simple sandwhich. Costs are convenient enough when it comes to a late night hunger."
"Could Be Better – Financial aid is pretty good with a above average ACT score for freshman, so take the ACT early and often. Make an appointment with a financial aid officer as soon as you know what your score is so you can have an idea of what you will get. Also, I would strongly suggest looking for outside scholarships to supplement aid from the college."
Wide Variety – There's everything from over 100 to in the negatives with the wind chill.
It's All New – I love my independence and freedom. I miss my family but they are only two hours away. It's all new experiences and it's all been good. I wonder if i should have gone somewhere closer to home but I would pick K-State again if I went back in time. Everyone says it's too difficult to have a job and be a college freshman. That is a load of garbage. I have two jobs and my grades and social life are just fine. People just say that because they think you will fail. Show them otherwise.
"Where Else but Kansas? One day it will be 70 degrees and sunny, the next it's freezing rain. Only in Kansas. There are days when the weather is awful and you wish you could stay in bed but for every freezing cold day/ hot as hell day, there is a breathtakingly beautiful day sure to follow."
Confused and Without a Guide – I'm not sure I want to stick with what I have. My advisor has been unhelpful. Honestly I haven't even been able to take a business class.
It's Ok...Of You Have Connections – It's not the easiest to get plugged into activities without knowing others or if you're if you are more shy. People tend to stay in there respective groups and it can be pretty hard to make friends as an incoming student.
There are not enough parking areas for the students to use. We have a huge parking garage but its not priced for college students. Trying to get a spot close to your class is virtually impossible. Expect a 10-15 minute walk depending on where your class is.
Campus Is Great – The campus offers many great places for students. The athletic facility is one of the best. The library is a wonderful place to go to get any studying done that you need to do. There are places all over campus to for students to stop in and study or rest. The Union is a great place to go not only for studying but for recreation and dining too.
It's Home – I've always lived in Manhattan so there is no way that I can say anything too terrible about it. Some of the housing is pretty expensive but you can find good deals. The nightlife isn't really that great unless you are over twenty-one but there are a couple spots for those who are eighteen and over. There is a great business district and overall Manhattan is a great place to live.
Pretty Safe – I normally feel safe on campus but it can get slightly scary at night. There are blue light safe light stops along most sidewalks and a saferide bus that helps students travels much safer. Police tend to keep a pretty good watch on the neighborhood too.
People Care – The police are really strict about underage drinking and speeding. Also the police are really good at catching drivers texting as it is against the law here.
"Party Campus – Aggieville (the bar district) is hoping every night for those 21 and frat parties are very popular for underage drinking. Lots of people go out and party after game, most people do."
"There are all kinds of people on campus. People are extremely friendly no matter who you are. You would think there wouldn't be a lot of racial diversity here in Kansas, but it seems to me there are a lot of Asians and African Americans."
"What's Your Clique? All of it's quite visible depending on where you go. Personally, I've seen a lack of peer-pressure and the people are still fun to be around. But if the people are being stupid about it, ie- doing it illegally, their activity will get shutdown."
Do Your Research – Generally their reputation will precede them. Just ask around with your upperclassmen if going to a particular party is a good idea. That way you can make an educated decision on which party to go to and have the most fun without any regrets.
Afterhours Events – The student union planning committee(UPC) and other organizations generally have so much going on that you'll have to choose between them. You're bound to find something you enjoy!
Always Have a Backup – I've lived in Kansas long enough to know that you should ALWAYS carry an extra jacket and umbrella in your car.
One Good Thing – There is a lot of diversity but for the most part people stay within their own cliques. Most races and ethnicities stick to themselves.
"Only Care About Accredidation – I've been to 5 different universities and have an undergraduate. This is the first university I've been to where I feel that my professors have absolutely no interest in their students and care only about their tenure. My advisor is helpful, but most of the staff that I talk to is unfriendly and talk down to students. Yes, they have office hours, but most of the time professors will tell yout that they've already given you the tools, and they do not listen to your questions. Instead they assume that you are trying to be lazy and only hear what they want to."
Manhattan is a nice town with a lot of attractions for college students. Everybody here is so nice to each other.
"This is by far the best college for me. I couldn't picture myself anywhere else. I always knew I wanted to go here, and with the wide variety of options for majors it has allowed me to experience many things. The activities on campus from athletics to shows are great to attend. The investment that the university puts into its students is amazing, and we just keep growing and growing. I would pick K-State everytime over any school in the entire world even if I would get free schooling. Nothing can beat this place. EMAW"
"They are average. Nothing to spectacular, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at the dining centers. The value for the food is pretty good. At the union there is okay food selection, but tends to get a bit old after a while."
"The computer labs at K-State are average. They are located around campus in areas where is important to have them. There is a problem during finals week and in the evenings. The network in continually worked on and goes down every so often and can be a bit slow at times. We get $10 of free printing, so it isnt too bad. It really helps to have your own computer. Wireless is throughout the campus which is very helpful too. By having your own computer you are set pretty well."
Fun and Nice – Kansas State has nice campus. The people here are very nice overall and you can always find some kind of activity going on. There's a lot of school pride and for good reason.
"Derby Menu – The Derb is very good for the first few weeks. After awhile, the food stays pretty much the same. The classics line is different everyday, but there are a lot of weird combinations that are unappetizing sometimes. I very much enjoy the Thursday Change-Ups line though. Also the soft serve ice cream should be fixed, that was my favorite part!"
Snow on Campus – The only bad thing is the frigid winters and snows that last for months. Walking through the slush and remnants of snow for months at a time is messing and annoying. But it's only for a few months until the weather is beautiful again.
"Greeks Are Great – The Greek life here at K-State is one of the best I've ever seen. Every Greek house is not only friendly with each other, but also with non-Greeks and are accepting of everyone on campus. Greek or not this campus is incredibly friendly and welcoming, especially with the Greek community always showing their pep."
"Apartments Are Everywhere – There are constantly apartment complexes and townhouse units being built all around Manhattan, I'm not sure about affordability, but with so many options available I'm sure there are great options within everyone's budget."
Drinking is a much bigger problem than drug use at KSU. I never feel endangered by a threat of drug use on campus.
"KSU Computer Success – The technology at this school is very up to date and is always updating itself. Overall, the technology and computers are extremely helpful at KSU."
Feel rushed to get FASFA application in by April 1st when my taxes and my parent's taxes are not completed yet.
New Sorority – The new sorority is doing great with involving themselves into the campus community and the surrounding community.
Diversity - Female Vs Male Ratio – There is plenty of diversity from several religions and from several different cultures and countries. Most students are either pilots or engineers with a growing population of students in new areas. The female/male ratio is pretty poor though. They are trying to get more females to attend with the addition of a social work degree area and a sorority.
"Off campus is expensive, but a better deal in the long run. There is a limit of four to a house/apartment. The safety is good. Parking can be kind of difficult because the city requires permits for certain areas of town. Definitely look for off street parking if you are going to live close to campus."
As is typical of an Engineering major I very rarely see things that aren't related to engineers. The engineering facilities are great the union is also good.
I feel safe on campus and in Manhattan in general.
"Van Zile Is the Best! I think the Van Zile Dining center is the best on campus because 1) there are few long lines 2) the food they offer is delicious and tastes really good unlike food in the Derby complex, where there is long lines for food that isn't as good."
"Quiet Room in Hale Library – This room is so beautiful and many say that it looks like the Great Hall in the Harry Potter books, which, for the most part, it does! Plus, it's a great place to study quietly and get a ton of work finished."
"There are parking paces for anyone who needs them, but a permit is required for parking. Depending on where you live, you might have to walk far to get to your car. However, housing does its best to get your allowed place to be close to your dorm."
"I have found that Kansas State is predominately Caucasian, especially in Agriculture classes, but there is a great level of diversity acceptance. I have even met another Native American!"
"Very Safe Campus – I always feel safe walking around campus by myself. I have not come across drunk people yet, but I'm sure I could find some if I went looking in town."
"I Love Kansas and Manhattan! Manhattan is a vibrant little town. There is a Wall Mart and Target, many quaint places to eat, and lots of townhouses mainly occupied by students. Then there's Aggieville nearby for those of us who might be over 21, if you get my meaning."
"Greeks as Roommates – My roommate is in the Greek system, and she is amazing."
"Religion Is Sometimes a Hot Button Like Everywhere Alse – It's nice to be able to debate about religion without people getting crazy. However, some people still do."
"Internet Connection Is Sometimes Shotty – While the internet is fast at Kansas State, every now and then it becomes very slow and unresponsive."
Kansas State really feels like an academic family. Even after you graduate.
Parking on campus is plentiful and close to classes.
"I only receive private scholarships, none from the university. Thus far, they have been very accomodating, effective, and punctual in processing the outside scholarships. I have never needed to constantly check my financial aid since the school is always on track."
"The campus does not make other computer labs well known. This is my final year here and I still only know of the lab in the library. The computers located there are reliable and have adequate speed and access. However, demand for use of a computer exceeds the amount of computers available."
"Here at K-State Salina they have helped out with everything I have needed help with. They also help with jobs, tutors, anything."
Good Campus – The campus here at K-State and the teaching staff (mostly) are what make this school so good. The campus itself is spread out but not to the point of making it difficult to get around campus. The campus itself is mostly isolated from the hustle and bustle of the town. The professors (the ones that speak English well) are mostly very good at their job and make it a good environment to learn in.
"The dining halls are the main place I eat since I'm a student living in the dorms. To be fair the food isn't bad but it gets pretty boring after a while. Also, it is almost impossible to avoid waiting in long lines at the dining halls which also makes it hard to eat your fill/"
"The engineering program is very time consuming for class work. However, this allows you to build great relationships with classmates and really explore the subject matter. Internships are fairly easy to come by, depending on the economy, and the facilities are pretty nice."
"Great Learning Environment – I am an engineering student and K-State offers great preparation for the ""real world."" Professors are usually eager to help, depending on the class size, and they offer a great learning envrionment."
"City Focused on the University – Manhattan is a nice sized town with more than meets the eye. The city is continually growing, and is populated with people who are in love with the students at K-State."
Being an Education Major – The program is really great. The professors stress important aspects of why education is important to teach and why it takes special people to be teachers. I feel like they want us to succeed and give us many opportunities to shine.
KSU Family – The town of Manhattan has a great atmosphere! The whole campus and community are one big family. The town supports the school and everything in town is K-State purple. It is a very welcoming atmosphere.
"off campus diining is very diverse, just as expensive as most areas i have lived but alot of bars!!!"
"Easy, but Would Like More – The process is very easy, but not much can be awarded unless you are a minority or a genius."
"Mix of Country and City – The guys are quite attractive and most are Christian and/or from smaller towns in Kansas. Girls tend to have similar traits. Greek life is one of the best ways to meet people with clubs and activities second. Even though there is a bit of a country feel here, there is still a diverse range of other types of people from varying backgrounds."
"The on-campus apartment housing is very affordable (as long as you have a roommate) and fairly close to the main campus. Many students bike to campus from the apartments. There are many apartments available in the area within just 2-blocks of campus that mainly students live in. The pros of living off-campus is that it's more quiet, so better for studying. Parking is pretty available near wherever one lives."
There are groups for every race. And you dont even have to be the the same race to join.... EX: HALO you dont have to be hispanic to join
There are campus police paroling 24-7... even at 5 in the morning...
The teachers are cool... and makes the class seem really easy.
"While I'm only 18 and haven't started my fall semester yet, I've heard that there is still plenty to do if your under 21. There are clubs and bars in Aggieville, which I've heard are really fun. Plus there are house parties as well as sorority/fraternity parties. Some parties cost to get into but it's only about $5 usually. Also there's a SafeRide service so you don't have to worry about paying for a ride back to campus."
"There are many labs available all over campus. I don't know how busy they will get during the fall as I'm an incoming freshman, but during the summer there was always plenty to go around. They are all of good quality. Printing services are available all around campus, some free and some not. So you don't really have to worry if you don't have a printer to bring to school."
I absolutely HATE with a passion KSU parking services. I once got a ticket for parking somewhere - the only freaking spot available to load my car to move out - I was living in the dorms. The parking services guy asked one girl to move so she wouldn't get a ticket and then just flat out ticketed me. I was SO mad.
"I like some people that are ""greek"" and definitely dislike others. I feel like at K-State some organizations and aspects of campus are only available to you if you are Greek which I feel is a bias that shouldn't exist. Just because some people want to rush and participate and others don't, I don't feel this should segregate the two groups."
On the Road – Most houses and apartments are in walking distance to the campus. Transportation should be mostly on foot and if you choose to live far away you know in advance you will need a ride.
Teen Problems – There is a strict policy of no cheating. The police are alert and take care of most teens and underage drinking. Drugs are not allowed ever.
Perfect Atmosphere – The stadium for football and basketball are in walking distance and stay clean. There is a mall nearby and a variety of places to eat at. I feel safe when walking to and from class too. Overall it is a friendly atmosphere.
"Great Athletic Pride – Kansas State isn't great at sports. We're doing good when we're sitting average. But go to a game and avoid eye contact with the scoreboard and you'll never know. The tailgating is great, the band, the pride- everything about them makes football games highlights of the fall and keeps basketball games hot all winter long."
"Go Coed. Every Time. The safest dorms to send yourself to, girls, are not the all girls dorms. The lack of male interaction creates crazy people who need an outlet. So conservative mothers, just know that Ford is no haven. Boyd would be a better option. If you're looking for fun, think Moore. Quiet hours in a wonderful lobby surrounded by upperclassmen? Putnam. Dirty, filthy, classic freshman experience? Haymaker. If you're looking for a suite, you'll be in a basement somewhere, but Putnam has some excellent rooms. Marlatt is pretty boring, and Goodnow is another Moore- just remember you're on the other end of the inhabited universe."
"The dining halls at Kansas State get a bad rap. The derb is an overcrowded cafeteria, but the salad bar is excellent. Van Zile doesn't have as many options, but hey, the food is excellent and the atmosphere borders on restaurant quality. Now, Cramer is admittedly lacking, but the people who eat there daily are pretty loyal to it- apparently it's homey."
"While I'm no expert on the drug scene. I can tell you that alcohol reigns king. It's everywhere, and not hard to get a hold of if you know people outside of your roommate."
Heating and Cooling – More than anything buildings on campus are old. They will always be far too cold or far too hot. Be warned.
"I Won't Say It's Easy. It hasn't been a cake walk getting through so far. But to be fair it's because the professors are pushing students as hard as they can. The courses are specifically designed to push out the week. So if you can make it through, you'll be better then anyone else."
No Buses – There isn't much for transportation on the Kansas State Campus. They don't offer transportation on campus but you don't really need to take a bus since the campus isn't that big in my opionion. A lof of people drive from off campus and pay to park or live close enough to walk. (That's what I did.)
"Something for Everyone – If you aren't involved in IM or play D1 sports, there is plenty of tailgating and other activities to be involved in. Kansas State University has great fans who are always looking for a good time!"
Professors Who Are Passionate About Their Subject – I took several science courses at Kansas State University which I very much enjoyed. The professors and their assistants were truly excited about their subjects which made classes fun and enjoyable.
"Never a Dull Night! Aggieville always a hot spot and greek parties are constant! Always a safe ride car available. Not a big into parties, no problem students host some awesome events all over campus."
Awesome Access and Technology – Tons of computers all over campus Free printing credits. Always reliable network and some of the best tech help around.
"Apparel and Textiles at Ksu – One of the top programs in the country! Incredible opportunities, internships and study abroad options."
"Very Complete – I think that the programs that KSU offers are great.The professors are willing to help you if you have difficulties. The hale library is good spaced place to study, has a lot of floors available and you can choose if you need a lot of concentration the quiet zone."
"I have many scholarships through K-State, but the academic scholarships seem like they are not reasonable. If you need financial aid, they seem like they try to work with you the best they can."
"I have just entered the education program, and I have been greatly satisfied with the program so far. The professors genuinely care about the students success and want to help as much as they can. Te curriculum is very stimulating."
"Aviation Campus – I came to Kansas State University because it has an Aviation program, the campus is great, and most of the professors I have had have been close to amazing. They are available to answer questions and give you extra help with course work. Class discussion is encouraged in smaller classes and makes it worth going to class."
"Great Library and Rec – The library at Kansas State is awesome. It has a lot of spaces for all different kinds of studying. The buildings and campus are always well kept. The Rec is also a great place for students to hang out, with lots of exercise equipment and other activities."
"Very Helpful Advisors – I'm in the College of Business at Kansas State, majoring in Marketing. I have a great advisor that is very helpful. She has helped me with many things from electives to take, clubs to join, and ways to save money."
"Fun People – The people in Manhattan are a lot of fun. Not many people care about where you come from, they are all very accepting and it's easy to meet new people and enjoy a good time with your new friends."
"Small Town – Manhattan is a very small town, but a very homey feel to it"
Helpful Teachers – The teachers are for the most part easy to get a hold of and they are always very helpful and flexible.
At KSU I have always felt safe and secure. They always have someone to walk you to and from anywhere you need in the dark and just make sure you are not loud and annoying or you will have to pay the price.
At KSU becoming a veterinarian is a very long and hard working process. You spend hours and hours working and helping animals so they can live and be happy. You take many classes and have to go through many hours of learning the anatomy of the animals and what you can do to save them.
"Kansas State is a very diverse and exciting place to be and they always accept you not matter your religion or sexuality. There are alot of white people that attend KSU, but they are also known for being called farmers or rednecks. Even though this may be the case the people that attend KSU are very down to earth people."
"K-state was a good choice. Have not had any difficulties. Many young people would be amazed at the overall helpfulness of the school, faculty, students, members, and community."
"I found that everyone is nice and helpful. Some areas did not have alot of parking, but overall the ease of the experience was great."
"Registration Process – The professionals working with the students at K-state are on top of things, and willing to help in every way they can."
La Fiesta – Great Mexican restaurant where the food is great and the employees are friendly! The food is quick and it's a great atmosphere to enjoy dinner with friends. They have drink specials and all their food is cheap.
"Cheating in the engineering department is pretty bad. No one ever gets caught however, when caught the penalty is a slap on the wrist."
"I think what sets K-state apart from the rest. Is the atmosphere, the academics and best of all the history. K-state is where MLK had his last speech. And the average gpa is 3.2 which is beyond what most schools are."
The Greek life on campus affects the social life on campus in so many ways. They are always involved in campus activities and they are what make a fun school to be at. Greeks keep the campus alive and makes K-State the way it is now.
K-state is known for their BIg 23 conference sports. The school and community and other places in Kansas supports K-state. And during football season everyone is wearing purple and yelling. Its very exciting
The college experience at Kansas State University in Salina Kansas is extremely challenging and rewarding. The aviation program is extensive and requires the flight hours necessary to obtain both a private license and commercial license. There are also other degree programs such as technology management for students interested in the management aspect of aviation and other fields. A student that attends Kansas State University in Salina is given the opportunity to reach their educational goal.
There are shuttle buses running constantly from the union to the parking lot and at night they have a Saferide bus system that runs on both sides of campus through Aggieville until 4 am on some nights.
As a freshman living in the dorms you have at least a 20-30 minute walk to your parking lot but there is a parking garage right next to the union for upper class-men and teachers.
They do a lot of great charity work for the community. They do like to have fun
Apartments are easy to find and fairly inexpensive. However you need to start looking in January. The best ones go early.
"Kites the Place to Be in Aggieville – Kites sports bar and grill is in Aggieville. It is within walking distance to campus,has a awsome atmosphere! and a exciting place to catch the wildcats in action when they are out of town. A great menu and reasonable priced with great drink specials."
"The Kansas State Salina campus does have some enforcers present but normally has no major use for them. The main thing to get in trouble for on this campus is speeding and not having a parking pass while parked in a non-visitor section.
While they tend to break up some parties the majority of them don't attempt to interrupt the fun unless they have real reason to do so."
"The athletics at Kansas State Salina are growing in numbers. This campus has basketball, cheer leading, baseball, and many other sports and sport like activities.
Kansas State of Salina has a bran new athletics department that has weights, a walking path, a basketball court, televisions, classes, and many other incentives. The best part is that as a student use of the facility is FREE!"
Kansas State SALINA Campus – The Kansas State SALINA campus has a majority of activities to be a part of. The classes are small enough to meet the needs of those wanting one on one with the teacher but big enough to socialize. The new recreation facility on campus contains many activities including a basket ball stadium and classes for fitness training. A number of degrees are offered through this campus.
my school has lots of activities going on. students are very involved in the things that go on in the union or activivties that frats put on. the games are always packed so we have tons of school pride.
living in the dorms and the apartments are ok. im kind of back and forth staying with the bf at his dorms and my apartment. somethings are a little over priced but other than that they have good areas for students to live and they try to keep housing for us close to campus.
"College Town – The town besides the college campus is relative small, with a small population. So the town is made or thrives of the campus activity. I gets most of its revenue from the student life. Consequently the high ends of the social and night life are seasonal as the students are in studies and attendance on campus."
"Greek Life – It has lots of interactive greek houses which engage with each other much, but when reaching out to the other students, this interactions could increase"
"APPLY QUICKLY – Scholarships are easy to come by at Kansas State, the deadlines just approach fast so apply quickly! I have recieved a substantial amount of financial aide from Kstate and am very greatful."
"With limited space, it is very hard to find a parking spot. Parking is expensive and difficult. With the new addition of a parking garage, things are getting better, but still frustrating the system they use."
"Very Accessible – The computer labs at K-State are often crowded, but there is generally always enough to go around. They make printing easy with several printing facilities. The wireless connection reaches all parts of campus making it easy to work anywhere. It is helpful but not necessary to have your own personal computer."
College Experience – Kansas State is a nice small central college. The city of Manhattan is a city for the college so to speak everyone is friendly on campus and off. The faculty are nice and easy to get along with. There is an even mixture of importance of college life and academics with the campus and city.
with the constantly changing and very unsteady Kansas weather walking across campus to get to class can be a trek. It can be nice outside during the beginning of the day but turn into horrible weather later. There are no enclosed walkways between campus buildings. Classes hardly ever get canceled here. When the weather is bad you see very little people outside but if it's nice the campus will come to life.
"Drugs and Alchohol – I have'nt seen much drug use since i have been here, but with a street full of bars near campus, there is a lot drinking going on at my campus."
There is a lot of diversity with k-state. They go out of their way to make sure there is no discrimination. A consequence of this is that in providing for minority's needs they sometimes neglect the majority.
"The engineering department here is really good, because the professors are more qualified than other departments'. They also demand more from each student, which will help us a lot in the future when we are working jobs."
Make This Clear: This Is Kansas State-Salina Campus – I love it! This is a smaller campus. I dont have a class over 30 students and the teachers make it a point to know each person in class by name. Everyone is really nice. For such a small campus there is a lot to do even if you can't leave and go into town. Just find a local. They can show you the true fun of Kansas. We are very creative.
"It Is Kansas! What else is there to say, this is Kansas. One day there is 11 inches of snow on the ground and the very next week it is almost 70. The wind is an almost everyday thing. You get to experience all weather conditions. The best school to learn to fly at."
"There Could Be More – There is not a lot of choice in Salina. Especially if you have pets. I'm a Salina native, so I currently live with my parents. If I could find an affordable place (a small rental rather than an apartment) that could accommodate my dog, cat and myself I would move out just to be on my own, but rentals around here are either not worth what they are asking for or not available at all."
"They Are Mediocre at Best. If you don't know anyone in Greek Life or you're not 21 or older, nightlife is not really for you. It is very exclusive. For those who do go, it is alright. It just depends on the night and the people who are hosting the parties and clubs that night. Most of the time it is mediocre at best, and you have to rely on the excitement of the friends you bring."
"My financial aid experience has been pretty good at the school. Of course more money would be great but they have been very helpful with my questions. If I came in for any reason, I would not be there very long because they seem to take care of the students right away."
I hardly ever hear anything about drugs around the school. I have never heard of anyone that had drugs or seen anyone that had drugs. I once smelt weed in one of the dorms but other than that it is a rare thing on campus that I know of.
I rarely hear about the party life of the Greeks. A lot of the time they are seen on campus as a positive thing. Very many do great things for the school and really get school spirit up. Some people that are within the Greek system do not always have the best attitudes towards other students but you deal with it. They don't seem to run the school or anything. They are there but not over bearing.
"K-State students are a special breed: it's easy to walk up to someone on Campus and ask for help; great for first-time students. The students mostly wear sedate colors, but that doesn't exclude the odd eccentric dresser, we're not particular! One thing that I really like on campus is the freedom for expression: you're not looked down upon for your looks or your views. We used to have a guy on campus who would play the bagpipes and he became a sort of symbol of our school freedom. Very close knit and hard core fans of the University, but still accepting to outsiders. An awesome combination!"
"You can find almost any food here, from Chinese to Pizza, to Good old McDonalds! Only a short walk away from the University, it's the perfect place to go for a meal! I personally prefer the Pizza Hut there. It's the oldest Pizza Hut still in operation! The food is good, the prices are affordable, and the ambiance is relaxing."
"They Do Not Play – The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted!"
"Not So Much – There are people of many different races and religions at KSU, but they comprise a negligible percentage of the student body. Most people here are white though, and the local people are pretty conservative too. This makes being a diverse campus quite challenging."
"It Could Be Worse – The places around campus are good. I guess you get kind of tired of eating at dining halls, but when you need something to eat between classes, you can't complain. K- State dining hall food is not all that bad, it just gets old sometimes. I suggest not buying a huge meal plan after freshman year"
"I Don't Drive Yet – For most of my friends, parking is relatively problematic. I live on campus so I don't drive yet, but most of the time the parking lots around our dorms have at least a few open spots. When you're trying to get places in other lots during classes, however, expect to be late if you don't plan ahead. It's near impossible to find parking around your classes in a timely fashion. Also, our parking services are very strict with tickets. They issue a lot of them."
"There are sporting events ALL the time. From inter-collegiate and conference games to smaller club team events, there's always something to interest me. We also have a great rec center. It is currently under construction and I can't wait to see all the new things they will bring to it. The campus is great; it just feels like home."
"Manhattan is the definition of a college town. It's fairly small, with most of the population coming from the large university. There is a fairly large variety of department/chain stores and Aggieville always seems like a good place to be for a night out, a good dinner, or just to walk around with some friends."
"I love that we get free tutoring and the teachers are very helpful, which impact our grades."
"Pretty safe, blue emergency lights throughout campus that when pressed alert the police"
"Overall, academics are pretty good, but sometime the teachers are not very enthusiastic about the subject and this results in poor teaching."
"At K-state there are plenty of libraries. The main library is Hale and I absolutely love studying there. It is spacious and usually a person can find an open computer. There are other small libraries throughout campus. Also, if you bring your own computer one can always recieve wireless internet."
"It was not difficult getting financial aid. There are parent and student loans, and parents tend to get the larger sum of that loan. Scholarships come fairly easy if you maintain good grades but its hard to get a larger or substantial amount. Always talk to the fiancial aid people in person, answers will be answered much clearer."
"Kstate is a pretty fun place to be. Greek life kind of takes over the social scene, but there is something for everyone to be involved in. Overall I really love it, although I wish it would be a little bit more liberal/ artsy."
Sports Events Are a Pretty Big Deal. sports events are something fun to go to and alot of the students attend games.
Main campus gets a lot of scholarships where as Salina is kinda limited. Very little support from main campus.
The strictness depends on the action if it is bad enough there will be punishment but most of the time it is just community service and that even rarely happens
The local restaurants are a great place to hang out with friends from the school. Half price appetizers at Apple Bee's draws in the students.
"Small but Friendly – This is a small school. They are very particular about who they allow into the school. I was one of the lucky ones. There are several classrooms, computer labs, and a library. All the classrooms have computers at the desks. The only times you need a personal computer is to do homework away from the school. If you do not have a personal computer, the school is open late at night and on the weekends."
Finical Aid – I applied for finical aid but was unable to receive any money.
KSU Has an international center therefore there is alot of diversity on campus. I currently live in the dorms and we have a resident assistant thats job is dedicated to diversity. Their job is to bring others together and help those with diversity issues.
"Derby Dinning Center – Lots of variety, good food, and healthy choices also."
"Dorm Life – wear deoderant and brush your teeth. the dorms are the place you meet the friends youll have all through your college career and post graduation life. its not mandatory, but i would live in the dorms my freshman year then move out."
parking passes are awarded not by seniority but by luck of the draw. parking is Fairly close but still a distance to walk. you might as well walk to class because theres little on campus parking. parking tickets are expensive so don't get them.
"The facilities on the KSU campus are beautiful. The campus itself is so clean and well kept. I would be honored to attend this university. Everyone is so kind, and i felt welcome and accepted even though I am younger than the current studnets."
"I received one of the highest scholarships awarded students at K-state, but I was rejected by my fair share as well. Overall, I am satisfied with how things turned out. Finding out about scholarships and applying for them was easy, and I received a letter in a respectable amount of time. A tip I have for getting financial aid is spend plenty of time on your essays. Write about something unique that really sets you apart from the other applicants. Write about something that you care about and get your reader to care. That is what's going to get you scholarships."
"If I had to do it again, I can say with assurance that I would absolutely choose K-State. I am truly more than a number here. I have met friends who I will be close to for the rest of my life. I have become involved both on and off campus and have created a network of friends and professionals that will undoubtedly come in handy after I graduate."
"Greeks Independent of Non-Greeks – Greek life at K-State is larger than at other schools, but non-Greeks have just as many opportunities as Greeks. For the most part, the two groups get along well, but members of fraternities and sororities tend to socialize with each other, and non-Greek students typically stick with one another."
"I cannot provide the paperwork neccessary to show financial need. Yet, I do need help. After visiting the dean of student life and of financial aid I was told my only option was loans. I do not want to be in debt especially with the current economic situation. I have fantastic grades but that is not enough for most scholarships."
Professors of Science and Nutrition – I have really enjoyed the professors especially of the Nutrition courses. They have prepared me for a future career and have taught information that I can use. I don't like the broad range of ethnicity of the science professors. The foreign professors are often very difficult to understand and don't always understand the American culture.
"Splish Splash – i once asked a friend in a wet fraternity just exactly how ""wet"" they were... the response? ""think water park"".. that pretty much explains the alcohol use...."
if your not 21...then you better have some friends that can hook you up with house parties...Usually there are lists of houses having a party that night. there are SOME houses that have parties every weekend that you learn to stay away from because the police catch on. There isnt much to do in manhattan so the police love nothing else than bust a party on weekends
not worth it – absolutely horrible. not worth the 150 bucks to get a permit
"if you look...you will find – if you look for drugs.. you will probably find them. But remember, you are in conservative Kansas...they dont take lightly to that sort of thing"
Worth It – I had a meeting with my addmissions rep before i enrolled here. i told him i had a very different high school career. He had me write an essay and submitted it to the Dean of Student Life. I got a $1000 from the deal
"Great Scholarship – I received a full tuition scholarship to K-State, and we have a lot of scholarships available to students, especially incoming freshman. However, I had great grades and a great ACT score--so I worked hard for my scholarship."
"Parking Is Average – Parking on campus used to be a lot more limited, but we just built a brand new parking garage in front of our student union, which has added a lot more parking spots for students and visitors. Overall, parking still isn't fantastic, but it has definitely improved."
"Good Introduction – Living in the dorms is a good intro to campus and a good opportunity to meet new people as a freshman. Some of the dorms, like Ford, are renovated and nicer. Others are a little older and run-down. I lived in a co-ed dorm, Moore, and it was fun to live with both guys and girls. Doors were always open and anyone could walk into a room and strike up a conversation."
"Social Life – Greek life is big here, but not essential to survival. There are a lot of nightly activities on campus. Even more happens off campus and the night life in Aggieville is always hoppin!"
"Here is what I have learned about off-campus housing. Location, location, location. Being really close to campus means shelling out the big bucks. Move a few blocks away and you're rolling in the dough. I still live within walking distance in a nice house and I pay way less than my friends who live in a small apartment right next to campus."
"Feeling Safe – I always feel safe walking anywhere on campus, even at night. Campus is well-lit and there a stations placed around campus where you can press a button and call the police. Also there is a service where they will send someone to walk with you if you feel unsafe. Excellent service!"
"Well, it is Kansas. I've lived here all my life so I guess you could say I'm used to it. Hot in the summer, cold in the winter. Average amount of snow."
"Facilities are great... Love all the limestone. Student center is exactly what I need/enjoy. Good place to study, meet up with friends, etc."
"I love it here. Always something going on, lots to do. Bigger town with a small hometown feel. Lots of good job opportunities. Wonderful people. Great place to be."
"Not Many Drugs – I have not experienced a bunch of drug scenes while at Kansas State University. It depends, however, on who you associate yourself with. The most popular drug I have seen goes to the extent of smoking, but alcohol is frequently seen at parties."
"Greek life is a central aspect of the campus. A large majority of both male and female are involved in some form of greek life, and you are considered odd if you are not involved. Most of the girls involved in the greek life are very clique-ish, while the males are rude, loud, and sexist. Despite these negativities, they do help the community in various ways, which is a great thing."
"I have really enjoyed the 5 semesters I have been here. The students, faculty, and Manhattan locals are very friendly and welcoming. People look out for each other. The classes are pretty good. There is a great push for education, and focusing on success past college. The resources provided for students are very helpful, and changes are made based on what students need. I would choose to come her again in a heartbeat."
"In the Animal Science Program, There Are Lots of Great Opportunities. The Animal Science Program is great. There are many classes that deal with specific interests of students. Also, there are lots of opportunities to do hands on learning. The professors are very willing to help students, and they apply what we learn in class to real, every day life situations."
The lots are few and far between and u usually have a hard time finding a spot.
Overall they are pretty good. They are pretty reliable and there isn't much down time ever.
"Safe Ride – The Kansas State campus is relatively small and most everything is in walking distance. This is helpful when there is drinking going on because you can get anywhere you need to on foot. The frat houses also have Designated Drivers on the weekends who shuttle people back and forth to where they need to go. The campus also has a bus system called ""Safe Ride"" and it is a free bus ride making many stops around campus so you have another sober, safe way home."
"Too Many Police? Riley county this year has gotten a new budget for the police force. There have been double the police force in Manhattan due to this extra funding. They are extremely bad when there is a holiday of some kind, such as Halloween. They give out their fair share of MICs to underage drinkers, but there is some leniency when it comes to large frat ""functions."" In Kansas they take drug possession a lot more serious than underage drinking crimes. Whatever you do, don't get caught with marijuana."
"Moderately Safe – There are many campus police as well as Riley County police in the Manhattan, KS area. There are emergency call stations if you do happen to be walking alone at night and you feel threatened. Kansas State also offers a system where you can call an escort to walk you back to the dorms if it is dark and you don't want to cross campus alone. But there have been incidents with abduction/assault before, the reason for me giving the security a B."
"K-State is a very diverse campus so you see people of all different looks, color, sex, etc."
Great Selection – The food on campus is great and several choices for everyone. They have healthy choices as well as selections for those with allergies or specific diets.
K-State has a great campus. Everyone is friendly and willing to have a conversation with you if you stop them. They are willing to help you out with whatever you need.
Best in the US – Aggieville is the colleges bar district and with over 21 bars in 1 square block it has no problem delivering plenty of night life to the entire school. Kites is the flagship bar in the district and it has been rated the number 1 college sports bar in the country in 2009. After the bars close finding a party is easy and there is usually one almost every block. On the weekends the town runs the Saferide program which will transport any student who is not able to drive to anywhere they want around the vicinity of campus.
"Discipline Wins Championships – Our student body is one of the most loyal and intimidating groups of fans in the nation. Kansas States teams are led by coaches who are old school strict disciplinarians, and have a knack for bringing out the best in every athlete they coach. Bill Snyder our football coach has not built a dynasty here but he has built a team every year that is competitive with anyone in the NCAA and has won multiple bowl games. Frank Martin our mens basketball coach led us to the elite eight game last year for the first time in over 30 years. Our football and basketball stadiums are all top notch and are easily accessible with plenty of tailgating room. Our fans are always filling the parking lots hours before games to tailgate before the game. IM sports have many participants and we never have trouble fielding a team."
"Anything You Want – Campus is surrounded by dense and diverse housing. Prices range anywhere from $250 dollars per room up to $600 dollars. The lower cost housing is typically older apartment complexes or houses a good distance away from campus, while the highest cost housing is in and around the main bar district which is also right next to campus. Apartments are the easiest to get into, every company that runs a complex posts their phone number or has an office in the complex. Houses are harder to find if you don't drive around town and they also get rented out quickly so you cannot wait to look. The biggest con is the condition of some of the houses and the landlords with too many properties, the houses get tore up by bad tenants and the landlords are not very worried about fixing them."
K-state is a family environment and you feel at home here.
"Greek Housing – Greek housing is so much better than the campus dorms, but the dorms are decent"
"Cost is average at most locations in aggieville, proxemity to campus is very convenient, and there is some variety."
"Little to no diversity. Seemingly more international students. But other than that, mostly white-dominant."
Not bad. Decent community atmosphere. Dining halls are exceptional. RA's are attentive and caring.
"There aren't many distractions here in Kansas, at least not compared to other places I have been. So a lot of people love to cheer on our sports teams because that gives them something to do. A lot of people in Kansas were born and raised here, so they grew up watching K-State play, and have been fans through the good times and the bad. Those are the best fans, because they always support the school no matter what."
"Exciting, Funfilled Atmosphere – K-State University is located in Manhatten, Kansas. Although the city is a small one, the school causes the city to come alive with activity. Businesses are friendly and accomodating. Groups are encouraged to gather and linger in atmospheres motivated my young scholars eagerly developing friendships and knowledge."
Parking is absolutely terrible and in no way worth the 150 dollars you spend for a permit. They sell way more permits than the amount of spots they have. If you are heading to a class in between 930 and 1200 you better plan on leaving and hour and a half early at least to find a spot in one of the lots. By far the worst parking experience i have ever seen. Nice work squeezing out more profit for themselves by the university though.
Safe Ride – Safe ride is an awesome way to get around after parties and intoxication
there seems to be a lot of places to eat on campus
Parking is okay. There needs to be more. The price of permits is expensive.
Professional Vs. Social – I'm part of a professional fraternity and it is fun to be a part of. I don't like many of the girls I know that are in sonorities
Library Is Helpful – The people working in the library are very helpful if a student needs to find something for a class
There is always something to do or get involved with
"Welcome to Kansas – Weather in Kansas is always changing. if it isn't rainy, it is humid. There are few days when it feels comfortable outside."
The campus has set up free rides on the weekends for anyone who participates in a drink so they are not driving drunk in town
Wireless Connection – The connection is sketchy at times when most needed. There is accessibility all over campus for anyone who may need it wherever they might be.
Kansas State Academic Honesty Policy – It is a very good thing to have because it keeps everyone honest. Every instructor that I have had will take all necessary steps to get a student kicked out of the college if the student is caught cheating.
"Parking has always been an issue at KSU. You can barely go a few weeks without hearing someone complaining about either not being able to find parking or that they got a ticket for parking. Recently, KSU built a new parking garage which has truely helped in most situations. Unfortunetly the price for parking passes is still pretty high. If you don't buy a parking pass you have to pay everytime you use the garage or you have to plug a meter. The Parking Services are sticklers about people who are parked where they're not suppose to be. As a college student, I'd rather not have to worry about where I have to park but how I can find a spot with ease and get to where I need to be."
"Drugs and Alcohol – At KSU the drug scene is pretty low key, at least to me. I'm not going to lie, I know some of my friends have partaken in some of these activities but I choose not to. I wouldn't say it's completely invisible but I don't normally see it. Alcohol on the other hand is much more abundant. Almost everyone I know drinks on the weekends and even sometimes during the week. Likely, I don't really see much peer pressure invloving it though. If a group of friends are drinking and one person decides not to, at first the group may ask why but then they usually leave it at that."
"KSU does a really good job of diversifying the campus to the best of their ability. Everywhere you walk you see people of different ethinic backgrounds, genders, ages, etc. Moving from a school with basically all white people to KSU was a bit of a surprise to me. The university offers many different ways to get involved on and off campus and this has allowed me and other fellow students to interact with different kinds of people I wouldn't have before."
"As long as you are 21. I am the person who loves to just relax, and the bar scene provides a place to relax, dance, or just get drunk to no end. If you are under the age of 21, I would suggest that you know a lot of people. House parties are your way to fun. I believe that there is only one place that allows 18+ and that is only once a week. Now that I am 21, I can say that night life is way more relaxed."
"Impossible to Just Say One or the Other – Everyone is different. The boys come in a lot of varieties. They range from urban big city all the way to the cowboy hats and wranglers country men. Females are the exact way. It is hard to say an overall, because there is no overall. I will say this however, there isn't much racial sensitivity at this university. Many people here in this university are from this state, and there are many preconcieved notions that people have about minorities."
"Interesting Yet Fun – Living on campus is very convienient. When I lived in the dorms I was very close to everything, and the food was good. I always had somebody to help me out with just about anything. Now I live in the on campus apartments, and they are awesome. There is a shuttle to campus, and I have the same support here as I did in the dorms. It is nice to live around students, it helps me to feel more welcome. I love it, otherwise I wouldn't have lived here for the past 3 years"
"Internship Opprotunities – Many companies seek K-State students for internships and co-ops, at all school job fairs, student union job fairs, engineering job fairs, and other similar events throughout the year. Of the students I work with, almost all of them have done at least one, and in some cases up to 5 internships and or co-ops during their time at K-State. In addition to internships and co-ops which often lead to employment, many students wishing to enter the honors program can find cooperate sponsorship for research done at the university, with access to a very knowledgeable faculty and staff, as well as very good laboratories, and a variety of equipment for design and prototyping of new designs, anywhere from CNC machining of a part, to low cost 3d printing not only for mechanical engineering students, but anyone on campus, which can be a very useful option for students in majors such as architecture and art."
"Friendly for It's Size – Although some of the general education classes such as chemistry and physics may have over 200 students in the lectures, instructors are willing to take time to talk with students if they are having difficulties. Office hours are fairly well set for instructors of all levels, from graduate training assistants, to post doctorate research professors. In the nuclear department, almost all instructors have an open door policy which allows students to ask questions not only of instructors, but also doctoral students, graduate students, reactor staff and management, and in some cases, even fellow undergraduate students employed by the nuclear research labs and facilities. There are many campus opportunities to have part time jobs, which not only give you a little extra money, but also allow you to interact more with fellow students and faculty. Undergraduate research assistants have the opportunity to work on multi-million dollar research projects and gain experience that is extremely marketable in the modern economy, putting students in a better position to get jobs after graduation. Many undergraduate research assistants also are able to transition from undergraduate studies, to graduate studies with very little change in routine, and often continue work on the same or similar projects, further expanding the hands on knowledge that they acquire during school."
"KSU Nuclear Program – The MNE faculty for the nuclear courses are some of the best I have met. Dr. Ken Shultis co-wrote the most used text book in the nation for nuclear engineering, and explains things very well, without going into to much depth on complex subjects unless specifically asked. Dr. McGregor is one of the leading researchers in his field, and teaches detection, which is also his field of research. Dr. Dunn is very easy to ask for help, and also teaches in addition to his research. Dr. Jeff Geuther, the KSU reactor manager, also teaches Reactor Operations Lab, which is an excellent course which can greatly benefit anyone interested in the operation of a reactor."
Class field trips provided my experience with transportation. It was great.
"Student Social Life – K-State has its policies, but most are outlined for the protection of the students."
"Room for Everything – From the Dining halls, student union, parking and classes, there is room for everyone. Always someone will to help you."
The weather at k-state seems cold most of the time. Kansas is either very hot or very cold. There are nice cool days but do not last long; they take place in the beginning of each fall semester. The weather does not really affect the mood and environment of the students. Most students enjoy college and do not mind weather that much since most students walk to their class.
"Kansas State has a variety of sports that one can choose to get involved in. There is badminton, bowling, basketball, soccer, football, volleyball, etc... Half of the games are very competitive and the other half the games are just played for fun and nothing else. The environment in the games are very supporting. The winner team will always get a free intramural shirt for each player."
"Dorms Dining Center – There is always a variety at the dining center. Every day of the week has its own meal plan, but every day serving a different dish. They serve delicious breakfast: scrambled eggs, they always provide bagels, pancakes, juice, milk, sausages, oatmeal, fruit, and cereal. The lunch is also very good. They always provide subs, a salad buffet, soup, and pizza. Dinner is where the variety comes. Sometimes they have foreign dishes, which are delicious and a lot of times they have typical american food: pizza, pasta, chicken with rice, ice cream for dessert, soup, salad."
There's not enough apartments for all the people who want off-campus housing. Their never available at the right time and they only become available during the summer.
Security is always on top of their jobs. They make me feel safe on campus. Even though we've had a few problems I still feel safe. I like how they have the program where u can press a button on campus if you don't want to walk alone at night. They also have safe ride. You can use it if your to far away from home on a weekend night.
Food or Drinks – The local atmosphere is great if your over 21. Im not 21 yet so its only restuarants for me to go to. The movies are always packed and so are the restuarants. Everything serves its purpose though.
"Right off campus is Aggieville that has loads of places to eat at affordable prices and great student discounts. There are also places on the east side and the west side of town that are easy driving distance from campus. These places work well with the university to create discounts mainly on Sunday night when the dining centers are not open, but do have deals as barggons during the week too."
Drug Scene – The drug scene at kansas state is low in my opinion. Alcohol is of average use but illicit drugs are not widely used.
"Free transportation is available for all students who cannot or don't want to drive on the weekends, although it is a small enough town many student just walk."
"Computer Labs – On campus there is eccelent wireless connectivity if you have your own computer. If you do not, then there are computers available in most buildings. As an engineering student I use the computer labs all the time. There are many math and cad programs loaded on the computers along with dual screen monitors available for in depth projects."
"Greek Everywhere – Greek life is pretty important, and very involve with the surrounding communities. Most of the time you wouldn't even expect some of the people that are to be greek."
Great School Spirit – Everyone is into all the sports no matter how the team is doing. you can always see people sporting there school pride through their colors on game days or on an everyday basis.
The professors at Kansas State University are very hands on and helpful. They are willing to make extra time in their schedules to work with you on learning the information. During finals there are always opportunities to attend review sessions and work on study guides. They welcome anyone with open arms and are egar to help students when they need it.
"Hale Library – Hale Library is a great resource on campus and once you get past how confusing it is to find books in such a huge library it's really a great place to study and get information you need! The librarians are really helpful and there are lots of little nooks to study in, plus on the main floor there are public computers (both Macs and PCs) available and large tables for group projects."
"I didn't have a car the first year and didn't need one. I now live in a sorority house very close to campus and still walk, so I don't know too much about the parking"
"there are atheletes, agricultural students, a variety of countries are represented, and the greek system has something for everyone"
There are many different options to live off-campus in Manhattan. The apartments here are not that expensive at all. There are also many houses that can be rented. There are many apartment and houses that are really close campus. There should be no problem finding a place to live off-campus!
"Around Manhattan – There are many different restaurant around Manhattan for students to eat off campus. They are not too expensive and most of them have specials or coupons that can be used on meals. Most of the restaurants are within walking distance to campus. If coming to Kansas State, you should definitely check out Buffalo Wild wings, they have 45 cents wings on Tuesday nights!"
"The school is indeed unique due to the oldness and tradition of the school. The white limestone texture of all the buildings is a sight to see, because coming from Miami, Florida, I never really see buildings of that stature. The vibe the athletics bring to the school is amazing as well, being apart of the basketball program gave me a first hand look at it, as students lit up as we became successful."
"Fun to Be Around – I am not in the Greek life, but I have many friends who are in either a sorority or a fraternity and they are for the most part, great people to hang around. The party life is present for sure, and they bring life to the campus, and students seem to be drawn towards them."
"Easy to Be Accepted – There are mostly white students here on campus, however, they are very accepting and I have never felt any signs of discrimination against me. Being a basketball manager here at k-State helps because i was instituted into a group of friends right away so i had a core group of people to build friendships around."
"Computer Labs for engineering students are plentiful. But, depending on the time of semester, it can get pretty full. Each computer uses two monitors. This is really helpful for some of the work that engineers have to do. The computers take a while to start up. That said, once they are up and running, they are reasonably quick. Reliability of the network seems to depend on how many users are on at the time. Wireless access is good. I have had no problems with printing. There is usually enough paper and ink."
"Conveniently, everything is ten minutes away from campus. So if you are without a car, it's pretty easy to walk everywhere. However if you choose not to walk, there is a shuttle that runs every hour for students. The shuttle is free, which is convenient for students and it transports students all over Manhattan, KS. If you need transportation from Manhattan to the airport in town, there are plenty of cheap cab services. However, if you need transportation from Manhattan to the airport in Kansas City, which is two hours away, there is also a shuttle that will take you there for just a fair cost of about $5."
"Drugs at KSU – As a drug free student at Kansas State University, I'm not really in tuned with the drug scene. I make sure to keep away from it. The people that I know that are a part of the drug scene have never pressured me into trying any drugs with them. Drug visibility on campus isn't really visible. Most people do it in the privacy of their own homes, especially since drugs and alcohol are not allowed on campus and in the dorms. The people I know that drink, do not do it on campus. They are aware of the consequences that comes with drinking on campus or in the dorms and they don't want to risk it."
"Food Options at KSU – There's a tremendous amount of options when you are looking for food at Kansas State University. If you are a typical college student, the dining halls would be more ideal. In the halls, there are four types of foods that you can get in line for. There is the Willie Wok line, which is a quick stir fry line whenever you feel like eating Chinese food. The Classics line is for the days when you want cooking that is close to home. The Italian or Mexican line contains everyone's favorite Italian food, pizza, as well as some type of pasta dish and tacos and burritos. The Deli line is the last line in the dining halls. This line consists of burgers, sandwiches, and hot dogs. If you are not a typical college student and actually have money to spend on food, the Student Union offers many options. It contains a Taco Bell, Panda Express, Chick-Fil-A, and numerous other restaurants. With so many options, and cheap ones at that, a student or visitor to Kansas State University can't go wrong"
"Manhattan, KS weather is bi-polar. One day it would hot then the next day it would rain or snow. You never know what the weather will be like each day."
Strictness Can Vary – Underage drinking and any type of illegal drug use in prohibited. If you get caught depending on the infraction it can me required special classes or expulsion
"Really Have Great Dorms – Although the dorms are older, they tend to be in pretty good shape. The rooms are comfortable. Bathrooms are cleaned daily, but there is never enough showers available. Usually have something social each month."
Usually Campus Problems – They have had some issues with muggings on campus and general theft. Do have a safe walk program. Usually it is just best to walk with at least 2 people after dark.
"Great Environment! Really educational and I would love to continue my education on this campus, because of the size of the classes which are mostly small, and teacher are alway willing to help during office hours. I would recommend this school to anyone ready for college, also for international student like me who have learned English just here and now can speak and write almost as a native speaker!"
"Not Often – Some students do go out, however the campus organizes parties sometimes and it's always fun! for example the cinco de mayo was awesome!"
Great Environment! This campus is amazing with two dorms; Residence hall and Harbin Hall. I live in the Harbin hall and it's safe and maintained regularly!
"Not enough parking places, they sell more permits than spots anyways. The permits are overpriced. Fines are too high. They should have 30 minute parking spots but don't."
"A Little Behind on Times – In Hale library the printing system is complicated and always crowded, so I don't go there. In the horticulture lab in Throckmorton the computers are old and a little slow, but have free printing, if you provide paper. Wireless internet around campus is sometimes hard to pick up, especially in Throckmorton."
"Safe at Night? During the day, campus feels really safe, but at night, there aren't alot of lights along the sidewalks and it gets kind of creepy.
Crime is what you would expect for a big college."
Kansas Is Not the Place for Me – I do not like attending school here at this university.
Punishments? I Don't Really Know – I don't really know that much about it. This year they cracked down on cell phones in classes though. Thats about it other than that their philosophy is your grown ups so if u mess up and fail out its on you.
There are almost all white students that attend this school. The ethnic community is very small in relation to the school. All of the ethnics are basically the athletes at k-state.
"hit and miss – The union has a huge variety of food, and a quite the cost. Derby typically has a long line, and you have to choose what you want before you get in line. Because each line leads to different food. Van Zile is set up better and smaller, but doesn't have all the food options Derby and Kramer does. Kramer is confusing! But they have the same food variety as Derby. It is just complicated to know where to go to get food."
"Basically a business degree with family studies and human services core. Classes offered are mostly during am hours, though."
"Not Much – There isn't a lot in the means of public transportation, if you want it you're going to have to hunt for it a little."
"Opinion Matters – Manhattan is a very spirited town when it comes to collge and many people choose where to live depending on what they personaly prefer. For the most part cost is fairly even, so it really come down to what you want as an individual."
"Student Center – Just recently been renovated and looks great! There's a huge gym, several different courts, aerobic areas, a track, a plasma TV when you feel lazy.. or if you want to hang out, there's pool tables and air hockey tables. Very student friendly!"
Not Very Very Big at All – Kansas is known for its intense drug laws so if you arent smoking then you arent doing drugs
Alot of Greek Houses – There are plenty of greek houses all right near each other and alot of which like to have parties every weekend but if your not in the house you better know someone because you need to be on a list most of the time to get in
Anderson Ave and Aggieville – There are enough good food places on Anderson avenue including a Houlihans and a few other place then if you venture half a mile further to Aggiville you have plenty of bars and grills the most famous of which is Hibachi Hut which is known for its excellent burgers. There are plenty of sandwich and fast food places in Aggieville as well which are all within a few blocks of each other
"There are tons of clubs, from skydiving club to chemistry club, everybody on campus is super friendly, smiling and holding doors open for anyone else, and very accepting of other cultures. We have a beautiful campus, with rusticated, crenelated buildings made of stone, and in springtime flowers and trees are in bloom, coloring the scenery. It's fantastic!"
"Awesome Athletes – Our sports rock, although we might not be the number one seed, the crowd is loud and proud, and every game is chuck full of fun and entertainment, not to mention our basketball team made it to the elite eight!"
"Guys at Kansas State – We've got all stereotypes, and a lot of those who aren't stereotypical. Frat boys are frat boys, and only have one thing on their mind. There are a handful of good guys here. A lot of good long lasting relationships around, and not everyone is shallow."
In kansas the weather can change at the drop of a hat. One day it might be 80 degrees and the next day it could be 40 degrees and snowing. You just have to be prepared.
"The Student Union – The student union offers a wide array of dining options there is home-style comfort food, taco-bell, a subway, and many other options. I never find it hard to find what I'm looking looking to eat."
"Campus Is as Safe as You Make It – As long as you are careful and demonstrate some situational awareness, there is little to worry about. As a man I never feel scared or intimidated to walk about campus at night, I have also noticed that the female population doesn't seem to be feel threatened while walking alone at night. The campus is well lit and if you are safe you need not worry about any personal harm."
"A Great Place to Learn! Kansas State is a great place all together, from social life to academic opportunities!"
I am not interested in Greek life. It is pretty popular on campus and they have a large fair to promote joining. Its kind of annoying how much participants try to get you to join but I understand they are just trying to get more people interested.
Sea of Purple – Everyone dresses how they want. You see a sea of purple though. The Wildcat support is phenomenal! We have amazing team support and cheer on our Wildcat athletes at every sporting event! People are friendly and helpful
There is quite a bit of diversity here at Kansas State University although it is still mostly white. The reason for this being that KSU is located in Northeastern Kansas where there is a lot of farming and these farmers need a proper education so they travel to KSU for their studies. KSU is not racist in any way shape or form but rather does not have as much ethnic diversity as some schools because of geographic location.
"The Recreational Center – K-State's Rec Center is amazing! It has a big variety of equipment, multiple gyms, an indoor track, racket courts, tennis courts, horse shoes and so much more! Students have free membership and there are a lot of fitness classes offered there too."
K-State has just built a new parking garage this year. It was very difficult to find parking places last year but now you can always find a spot in the garage! There are multiple parking lots in campus too.
Hale Library Is a Great Place to Study – I live out of town and Hale Library is a great place to go for those long hours in between classes. It has all the resources you will need and even has a 24 hour study lab. It makes things so much more convenient.
"Not Much Needed – The Salina campus is rather small, so there is not a big need for transportation. Although I have heard that main campus provides a shuttle bus to the campus from the football field."
"Campus Is Pretty Laid Back – The only thing I can think of that the school is super strict about is having parking passes and parking in the right lots. Other than that, all other rules are reasonable."
"More Drinking Than Drugs – Drinking is a much more common activity than drugs. I don't think any drugs are ever actually taken on campus, but I have seen alcohol in the dorms before."
School Spirit – At Kansas state u find that almost everyone is a participating member in the sports programs. People are either on the team or in the stands cheering on their team. Participation in these activities is very good and everyone loves being there.
"Both Extreme – Kansas experiences both cold winters and hot summers. There is a nice variety, but the extremes are not so pleasant. Especially the hot, humid summers."
"I have only heard stories from other, but have never lived in an off-campus housing complex at K-State so I feel I cannot accurately rate it."
"Night Life – Night life isn't so much fun, but you have to think most students that go here have to work extremly hard at there school work. Night life would distract you dramticly."
"Goodnow, Marlatt, Jardine, Haymaker.......! The residence halls are great at Kansas State. There is a distinct sense of community on each of the different floors and I know that on my floor I have made some great lifelong friends. They are close to campus and are not too small. Perfect for freshman and cost efficient for every student!"
Aggieville Food – In Aggieville there are many differents restaurants to choose from with a variety of foods at a pretty low price. The only problem is that on Sunday nights the residence dining halls are not open so the restaurants get busy very quickly.
"Most of the computer in labs and in the library are Mac's which is not a problem but there are limited numbers of them so sometimes it is hard to get onto one. For students who have their own computers, the WiFi is pretty good around campus but is lacking a bit in the residence halls where it seems to be the most needed."
"Hale Library – The library at Kansas State is one of the greatest places on campus. The warm ambiance hits you as soon as you walk in the door and creates a comfortable environment to read, study, hang out, or even take a nap. With its coffee shop on the ground floor and the Harry Potter Great Room, Hale is the one place I just could stay in forever on campus."
Manhattan Sucks – If you don't fit the stereotype of the Bro or Trixy you will not fit in. You will have insults hurled at you by people passing in cars. If you're a freshman male not in a frat good luck.
