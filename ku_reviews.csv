I like how big the campus is and how the university caters to the student. One thing I wish was better would be the food at some of the dining halls.
University of Kansas is a very nice university with much diversity in a warm climate. The community is very kind and the classes are challenging.
Academics are great! Great professors! The campus is beautiful and staff is wonderful and very helpful.
"As both of my parents went there and I live in a town with mostly KU grads, I have been entrenched in KU my entire life, and now that I am going to college, it is KU that I have selected. My only complaint is the winter weather."
"Overall, the University of Kansas is a great place to go to school. All the teachers I've had really care about their students' success. There are tons of resources available for students."
"KU really wasn't all that I was expecting. Some of the faculty members are great and very helpful, while a lot of the professors I have dealt with were a little questionable. I definitely had high expectations since I am from out of state, but sadly the school didn't live up to those expectations. Other than that, the academics are pretty good and the campus is very easy to navigate."
"The campus was excellent and full of life. The tour and the tour guide were professional and well prepared. Despite the large group I was traveling in, the experience still felt very personal. I was impressed by the immense size of the school and amount of fields they offer."
Overall the University of Kansas is a pretty good school. People are usually friendly and some departments seem really on top of things. Though I believe their Math Department in particular needs work. The Math department seems to hire many teachers who are difficult to understand.
"I went on a tour a few weeks ago and can officially say that i have found my home for the next four years. Everyone on campus is so nice and is willing to help you with anything. Prior to applying, I was hesitant to look at a Kansas school but now I am so happy that I applied and am committed to this university. Rock Chalk Jay Hawk!!!"
"Though it is a large university, it works hard on breaking down class sizes and having tons of events happening for students to be involved in. It has a good transportation system that is linked to Lawrence Transit, so you have a lot of ways to get out of campus to do things like shop at Wal-Mart. There are a lot of ways to fulfill the gen-ed requirements, which is helpful for someone who doesn't necessarily want to take a science class at the college level."
"Even though I didn't go to the main campus, I attended their subcampus, Edwards. The staff and faculties were very friendly, and they were very helpful. They made the environment very friendly. The teachings were very challenging, but the professors are always there to help you out."
"I have found a community of students, teachers, and friends that want to support me through my studies and see me succeed. The University of Kansas provides endless opportunities that will match your interests and pursuits!"
"I just started at KU in the fall of 2017. I have had a very positive experience with teachers, classes and KU staff. Great place to attend school and start your next step towards your future."
"During my first year at the University of Kansas, I have collected a multitude of different experiences. The campus is beautiful, no doubt about it. Not only is the campus wonderful, but the education system is great as well. Professors care about each and every student's success in school and outside of school. The most impressive aspect, I have become familiar with in my time at the University of Kansas was the student resources put in place to help, motivate, and support students going through a tough time. Whether it be health, educational, or personal issues; there is a program or person available to students. I appreciate the demonstration of care at the University of Kansas."
"The University of Kansas has a very diverse group of students. The Lawrence environment allows students to bond and make those long term connections that will help better their future. The professors and other KU staff provide a welcoming environment to, not only, the students and faculty of KU, but also the local citizens of Lawrence. A few times a month you'll see local kids from schools located near or in Lawrence that come and tour the campus, ku is all about starting the traditions from a young age. KU is well know for their basketball team, and students are constantly encouraged to come out to home games."
"I graduated with an engineering degree with honors and passed the FE exam in electrical engineering by 2015. I have not been able to get a job in the USA even as a garbage man since then. It is harder to find work now than it was when I was in High School. I suppose the employers think I'm too qualified. So my degree is worth less than toilet paper and it is considerably more expensive. The career fairs and the career center are entirely useless. Also, before I graduated, I went on a fake exchange program sponsored by KU; the university took my parents' money and did nothing with it. I had to figure out which classes to take on my own and the university did not transfer the credits when I got back. If you have $50000 dollars that you don't know what to do with, spending it on alcohol and prostitutes would be a better long-term investment than going to KU. And I mean that quite literally. KU has harmed my career prospects rather than helped."
"KU has been a great place to study. It is in a beautiful part of Kansas, and the university has numerous traditions that I am proud to be a part of. Additionally, the university offers many forms of support for students from classes to daily life. There is always something going on and something to be a part of; I don't know how you could get bored."
"I like that the University of Kansas is really diverse. There are many cultures, religions, and traditions showcased every week. No one group of people is excluded, they all take the chance to show what they do and how each of them come together and work alongside one another.
To make this University better, I would suggest having more communication between the school. Such as the Performing Arts school interacting with the Business school. The Law school's faculty and students socializing with those from the Architecture school. I do not think there is enough communication between each of the schools to benefit student who identify with each."
"Once you get pass all the general classes, the class size are generally small and teachers are very easy to get along with."
"Amazing campus. Traditions. Great athletic teams. Teacher are very helpful and flexible. So much room for growth and so much support. The town is amazing as well. With Kansas City 20 minutes away, you'll never get bored."
"KU has a diverse campus with endless opportunities for education, career counseling and fantastic student life."
This college is amazing I recommend that all incoming students live in or around the campus in order to experience the entire college experience.
"I am a freshman at the University of Kansas and for the most part it has been an incredible experience. My least favorite thing about the campus is the hills and how spread out it is, but the teachers and the classes are the best part about the school."
"This school has already brought me so many opportunities to looking deeper into my future career. It not only has been extremely beneficial to my academics, but one of my favorite things about KU is it’s tradition. Allen fieldhouse, the steam whistle, and the campanile are just some of my favorites. KU is a great place to make new friends and memories that’ll last a life time!"
"The University of Kansas has prepared me for life after college by pushing me to pursue my goals and dreams. While the curriculum has been difficult, it has also proved rewarding by getting me involved in countless hours of research, rewarded by Undergraduate Symposiums and visits to other cities to represent my school in quiz bowls and research presentations. The tools and values that I have gained while at the University will prove worthy for several years down the road and the experiences that I have gained here will never be forgotten."
"As it is a large school, you have to be motivated and reach out to professors when it comes to academics. However, the town and social life are great for undergrads."
The feel of the school is amazing. I knew it was the right one as soon as I saw it. I will be attending there in the fall of 2018.
"The campus is awesome! There is always something to do, no matter your social group or the day of the week!"
"The University of Kansas is highly ranked in multiple fields of academics. Lawrence is very diverse; it is the San Francisco of Kansas. KU's men's basketball is great, but you truly do not understand the love this school has for that team until you have been to a game inside Allen Fieldhouse in the student section-- you will get goosebumps. Even if you are more of a football fan, tailgating is always a good time. Each one of the professors I have had has made me feel like they value whether their students actually understand the material or not. I have yet to have a professor who is unwilling to work with each student's individual schedule to find a time to work with them 1-on-1. Living in the dorms freshman year is more about the experience and meeting new people. KU has newer cafeterias on campus that serve food that is actually fresh. The party scene in LFK is unreal. There is always something to do here. Rock Chalk!"
I've had an incredible 4 years at the University of Kansas and will also be completing my master's program here as well.
This school is the most amazing school out there. The professors truly care about the success of the students. The athletics are beyond amazing and truly give you goosebumps. I highly recommend this school to anyone in the world. I am so glad that I am here!
This school is the best decision I have ever made. I truly learn so much here and the people are just amazing all around! They really care about your success in and out of the classroom!
"I have been attending this school for half a year. So far, I have found it enjoyable. Staff is usually helpful in all departments. There are constant events and lectures going on. My only complaint is that many of the professors have bad reviews, so it's sometimes hard to find classes without worrying about the professor. The food offered at the union is also very limited and mediocre."
"I went on a visit to KU and loved it. It is one of my top choices for next year. The campus is beautiful. The people there are positive and and actually wanting to learn. The academic environment is great, there are so many places to study, and the professors want to help. The town of Lawrence is also great. There are so many places to eat and hangout."
"I have met so many great professors and people here. Living in a scholarship hall has really changed my view of dorm living, there is such a great community here."
"Amazing Campus. I took the tour and am planning on attending so this school sold me through their class offerings, great honors program, and amazing campus. The students are helpful and accepting as well. A very great school choice."
"The University of Kansas is a great four year college that I believe exceeds academic standards and has a very active campus life. Starting with academics, all classes I've been in have been highly organized with professors who actually try to help their students. They won't reach out to students, but once you make yourself known to them they are excellent resources who befriend and network the students who come and ask questions. On campus, there is something for everybody. There are tons of diverse clubs and organizations encouraging students to join. If extra curricular activities aren't for you, Lawrence itself is a great place with a lot of little shops and restaurants and businesses. Greek life is very big here, but if you're not in a sorority or fraternity thats okay! You can still have a successful college experience without having to be a part of greek life. Overall, KU is a great place."
I love this university! It is a very fun place to live and it has a very rich history and a culture. When i am at KU I feel like i am home
"I've stayed on campus for summer camps--they are always fun! The dorms are nice, most newly remodeled or newly built. The campus cafeteria is Mrs. E's and they always have a variety of meals and times to eat. The academic and cultural atmosphere of the campus and town are unbeatable. I love Lawrence, and look forward to living there as a student."
"100% glad this is the school I chose, only thing that sucks is on campus parking, but still better than a lot of other universities"
"This is a good college with professors who care, lots of research opportunity, and a top ranked honors program."
As an incoming freshman I was very nervous to start my journey as a college student. Once move-in day came around I no longer had that nervous feeling in my gut. I felt like I was home. The friendly and very helpful students on orientation day made me feel like I truly belonged. I knew this was the place I wanted to spend my next 4 years.
"So far the first semester of Freshman year had been good, Everyone I've met there so far has been super friendly and outgoing. All the professors have been great instructors."
"I only have good things to say about the University of Kansas. I feel blessed to go there and be a part of the Jayhawk tradition. Going to basketball games, sitting in Budig Hall, and eating at Mrs. E's; all of those things are what brings me closer to the school. I believe KU only hires the best and brightest professors who care about each and every student's education. I've made long lasting friendships in the short amount of time that I have been there, and I can't wait to continue my education at the university."
The University of Kansas is great. There are a lot of resources for students who do not know which path they would like to take. The school spirit is great. However getting use of these resources can be hard. You have to wait to have access to these resources.
"It's a good university with many opportunities to study, learn and explore. They have many different classes and clubs to partake in. The university is diverse and the local area is fun to explore and walk around. From what i have experienced it is a good university and a pretty nice campus with many opportunities."
"It's a great university. One thing I would change is hire better, actual teachers. Most of the professors are researchers, not teachers."
I love it here! University of Kansas Is like a home away from home. Every time I step in a class I always feel safe and welcomed. I’m happy to say I will be spending 4 years at the University of my dreams.
"The University of Kansas has helped me pursue my educational dream of becoming a Social Worker. Given me the opportunity to meet so many great people from around the country. MY professors at the university have been great, for the most part. They are very encouraging and want the best for my education."
The University of Kansas has a beautiful campus paired with great academic resources. Our basketball team provides a wonderful opportunity to go out with friends and watch wins happen in the legendary Allen Field House.
"I love KU. Lawrence is great town and the school has great people. It is a large enough university that there is truly something for everyone here at KU whether you enjoy sports, art, or humanitarian work. I've loved my experience here and can't imagine being anywhere else."
"The best college in the world. I love it I come from a small town in Colorado and was never able to visit,"
KU is a beautiful campus coupled with an incredibly diverse student-body and highly-educated staff. My college experience were some of the best days of my life. Being on campus is relaxing and motivating.
"Love being here! Everything is great. Campus is safe, sports are good (except football), and the housing and dorms are fun!"
KU is a very well rounded school with students and faculty from all walks of life. They all provide a very welcoming fun college experience for incoming students. The community around the college is also very welcoming. While basketball is the sport of choice for the school other sports are available for viewing and participating in. There are many clubs available for anyone and majors to fit your goals for the future. Greek life isn't essential but it does have a presence on campus.
"The University of Kansas really put an impression on me, not only because of the massive size of the school, but because of the different kinds of people you meet. Everybody is nice and can easily start a conversation. Classes are fun to be in, and professors are there for you."
The University of Kansas is unlike any other university. Its beautiful campus and school pride beat out all the other schools in the big 12. Not to mention its basketball team is A1 and so fun to cheer on. Everyone loves being a jayhawk despite the crappy football team and hilly campus.
"The University of Kansas is a very great college. The community is very welcoming and definitely feels like a college town. It does not have great parking, but other than that, it is great."
"The university has a very welcoming atmosphere. The application process was also very east, as well as enrolling and figuring out my next steps."
"I love the University of Kansas! I come a small town in Illinois, and I never had the chance to visit this campus because I didn't have the money. From just simply looking at the campus online and the opportunities I will get I fell in love. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the administration is so passionate about education. They're always there to help with anything you need. There are so many job opportunities for students that need some money. There are hundreds of different clubs that students can join. It is a great community."
"The people are nice and funny but the campus isn't pretty and too many hills. However, I loveeee the basketball games and how everyone comes together."
"It is a beautiful campus, has a great student life, and has a stunning downtown. Everyone can feel at home in Lawrence. The midwest charm gives it the warm and fuzzy feeling. Also, the sports (basketball) draws everyone to Lawrence. Rock Chalk Jayhawk!"
I recently took a tour of the University of Kansas and completely fell in love. In the beginning of the tour our speaker failed to let any of the staff know she was sick. We ended up starting the talk late. It was very informal and came off unproffesionsal. But after the talk it was time to begin the tour. The divided he students by what major they were looking into. Mine was Architecture. I ended up getting a private our of the campus because I was the only student in that field. I got to tour the Architecture building and the engineering building. I saw students in action and some of their work. I was amazed. The tour was full of information. I fell in love with the look of the campus. I started to see myself attending The University of Kansas. Later that night I finished my application ad received an acceptance email only a few days later. I am so excited to have to potential opportunity to become a Jayhawk at an amazing university.
"The University of Kansas has always held a special place in my heart. Since I was born, I have been rooting on the KU Basketball team and wouldn't trade my love for the Jayhawks for anything! Even though I am only a first semester freshman, I have already created so many amazing memories at KU. From Sorority Recruitment, to football games, to Late Night in the Phog, I have enjoyed every second, even the countless hours of studying! KU is such a unique place that is filled with many different people and personalities, and I cannot wait to see what else is in store for me here."
"It is a phenomenal educational opportunity, you will fall in love with the people, the scenery, the buildings, your professors, your classes, the basketball program. I can go on and on well beyond the limits of this review. The one knock I have is price, as an out of state student I rely on an annually renewed scholarship to keep it affordable, but even then the price is steep. You get what you pay for, however, and the University of Kansas is a worthwhile investment."
"Touring the campus I met so many students that had nothing but good to talk about this university. It is very diverse, has numerous clubs to join and activities to help each person find their own way to get involved and feel a part of something. There is so much school pride here."
"Outstanding. Best teachers, Friendly students, Great Campus, wonder activities, good value for your money, no 1 rated basketball team"
"The University of Kansas has been one of the best organizations I have ever worked with. Responsive employees in every department, flexible, and professional. This is a well-run school and provides lots of research opportunities."
"As a freshman, I love it. The staff and campus is awesome. The city, Lawrence, is the best as well. I am very happy with the decision I made, and I am excited for anyone who chooses KU as their new home."
I loved the environment and how peaceful it is. Sports are great and successful. The campus is a bit too spread out.
"Great school across the board! Great academics, athletics, student life, mentorship, and more! Many opportunities for success, lots of research opportunities, endless amounts of options!"
"I've only been attending the University of Kansas for a couple of weeks. So far, so good. The campus offers everything an incoming student needs. The professors are professional and caring. Dorms are a bit small and campus food is descent. I feel safe on campus."
I have never been a student at the University of Kansas. I have heard through several current students that they have a spectacular medical program and housing facilities.
"So far since I've been here the only problem is the amount it costs of living comfortably. All college students are in debt and that's part of the process, but it's becoming an actual burden on my lifestyle. However, the actual classes and environment of KU are amazing. They make me feel as if I've found my home and that's something I've never been able to have."
"Transitioning from a small town, where the population was that of the university, was surprisingly easy. It was easy because everyone here is so friendly. There are plenty of was to get involved on campus rather it's being in a scholarship hall to becoming a tutor. The university was a new chance for me to express myself in ways I couldn't at my home town."
There are so many great events and organizations that are so easily accessible and welcoming. They help to make you and better person and learn so much more about the world and even yourself while meeting new people and experiencing new things.
I am going into my first year and I have to say that the administration really cares for its students and has our best interest in mind. I've yet to have a professor that hasn't made the classes the best they can be.
They're a really great college and they're good about helping you succeed and pass And eventually graduate. They have a lot of helpful resources available and the staff and students are helpful and nice.
"I am obsessed with KU! This school has endless opportunities. KU thrives on tradition and basketball. When I had first visited KU, I knew right a way that this was the place where I wanted my future to begin. Not only is the campus absolutely beautiful, everyone is very charismatic. The University of Kansas is my home a way from home, and I could not be happier."
My experience at KU was life changing. The people are so nice and very helpful. You never have to go through anything alone. There's always help around and useful resources you can use. It's like home away from home.
"In my three years here at KU, I have had many experiences that have uniquely shaped the person I've become. Pulling from all regions of Kansas and the greater midwest, the fellow students are welcoming and friendly and the teachers dedicated. Students will often find that they get out of their academics what they put in. While individual programs vary in their strength, a committed student will find no shortfall of administration and faculty who are ready to supplement their learning with experiences."
I'm in the repiratory Therapy bachelors program and it is not put together very well. The teachers are not interested in teaching and it shows.
KU is a great school. Great atmosphere to learn and a lot of diversity. Faculty members are kind and want you to succeed.
"I really enjoyed my first semester at KU, the Campus is beautiful, and the professors are fantastic."
"My experience being at the university of kansas has been a good experience. From meeting different people to meeting different teachers. There is something always available to you at every moment during the school year. The atmosphere is a great and unique experience. The class work is what you expect not too hard, but stay ahead!"
"The University of Kansas will provide the campus experience, however, I wish I had transferred to a different school sadly. My time at KU has been very enriching in some ways but not in all ways. I have taken courses were the professors, or instructors were completely inadequate. They have students paying way too much money for an education, let alone just to eat on campus. Lastly, I feel that students have to make an experience there, they're not really given the experience like I hear other students from other schools describe college life. I'm not sure if I'm being too harsh but I honestly did not care for the school itself. However, I'm glad I made the experience worth while for myself."
"At first I was not interested in paying to much attention to 'college life', especially since it seemed generalized. I just wanted to go to class and spend time with my friends. However, when classes started (this was during the 2016 presidential election) the teachers somehow managed to suck me into organizations that KU offered. I dived into politics and social justice on and off campus. One thing I would like to change would be to make the non traditional classes, such as feminism in Disney movies, more advertised to students instead of the traditional English classes."
I love the University of Kansas because everyone is so friendly and helpful there. It is easy to find the right path for every student.
This school is large and chances are you will find your niche in its expanse of programs. Some of the teachers I have had at this school are incredible and have made a lasting impact on my life.
"The campus is beautiful and the buildings are amazing. You will have classes all over campus and be able to see and learn so many great things about what makes KU special. Class sizes range from small and intimate classes with only twenty students, to large lectures with up to 700 other students."
"I liked how many options and opportunities are available for students to explore and earn degrees and gain experience needed for their area of study. The courses are generally at a fair level of difficulty. Some departments are a lot more difficult than others, and course difficulty also depends on the professor. But overall, a very good institution for undergraduate learning and earning a degree."
I have really enjoyed my experience here so far. All the professors have been timely in getting back with me and making sure to answer any questions I've had. The bus system has been my way of transportation and they also have made that very easy.
"I like how everyone seems to have each others back. From students, to professors, there is always someone there willing to help. There's a lot of school spirit at KU, and everyone takes pride in attending. If can change anything, it would to be able to add more diversity to the campus"
"University of Kansas is a great school where I met friends the second I walked in my first class. Teachers and professors really care about you and are willing to help you in every way possible so you can succeed. The school also offers an incredible amount of free resources to help you for the future, such as writing centers, resume checks, and mock interviews."
"I am currently a student at the University of Kansas and I love attending there for classes. The teachers are knowledgeable, the students are friendly, and the town is small enough that you can bus, bike, drive, or even walk from and to campus as well as work."
"KU is a solid school to go to. I'm an Electrical Engineering student so I can really only speak for the EECS school. The campus is great. It's plenty large enough so it doesn't feel like it's cramped at all. There's always events going on around campus, and the people are generally great. It's relatively cheap for the type of education that you're getting as well. The professors are hit and miss. I've some terrible ones, and I've had some fantastic ones. People here all share a similar story on that front. Off campus, Lawrence in general is small but packed with cool things to do. Mass St. is where all the bars and restaurants are. You'll probably find yourself spending plenty of weekend nights there. We're also located about 30 minutes away from Kansas City if you want to shop at the malls or do other things."
"I love everything about KU. There is a lot of pride that comes from being a Jayhawk. Not only attending the basketball games in the nation's best stadium amazing, so is learning through KU. I have become a more well rounded person. I have learned so much more than I expected at such a young age. I absolutely love it."
"For the most part, the University of Kansas is great. I chose this school because I wanted in-state tuition, and it has a top-notch journalism school."
"Overall, my experience at KU has been a good one. I have been able to become involved in research in the biology department. I would like to see more help in locating summer internships."
I came to the University of Kansas because I was interested in the school of architecture. As a sophomore here at the University of Kansas my experience has been very good.
KU is a welcoming school that provides many opportunities for students to succeed. I found my home here as a Jayhawk and there is nothing quite like the atmosphere in Lawrence.
Good basketball program but very bad football program as the school is easy to get into and is very diverse because of it. The surroundings is in the middle of nowhere. Nightlife is bad because of it as the academics is mediocre. Some cute females are there but overall a decent school.
"I have had a really great time at KU so far. It's a big campus that doesn't make you feel like a number while you're there. If you love basketball and love great academics, there's no other place for you."
"My experience has been mixed. Love the program I'm in, campus is hands down beautiful, but some professors could be more receptive to the needs of students. Are they there for the students or strictly for the money and research? Actually teaching the material would be a great idea."
"I like KU. The campus is clean, the people are friendly the professors are personable. There is always something for everyone to do."
"University of Kansas is an amazing school that has anything you could ever want to be involved in. Academic programs are high quality and the campus is beautiful. Haven't had a professor that wasn't top of their field. There is so much school spirit and an overall friendliness on campus. The party scene is amazing, there's always stuff happening. The Lawrence area is a cool place to go and hang out with friends, get good food, and shop. I've never felt unsafe on campus and KU police are always around. Dorms are pretty nice as far as dorms go as well as the dorm food. Pretty good amount of diversity for a Midwestern school. Many choices for athletics through clubs and intramurals and obviously the men's basketball provides fun for home and away games. Football games are a lot of fun too despite not having a winning team all the time."
"Mixed feelings. It's almost depressing how little problems such underage drinking and drug use are monitored. Some kids have told me they come here just because they know it's impossible to monitor 24,000 kids. As someone who came to college really wanting higher education, I'm probably biased in that I had no interest in sports) or a big social life. But if you come here, that’s a highly viable option. And I think that’s what most people want. It’s distracting to more studious students, but such is college nowadays. To be fair, it's pretty impressive what the university has done. It has great social integration (full programs dedicated to colored students and LGBTQ) and that doesn't happen everywhere. They've given a number of ways for all kids to find what they want to do and give a pretty large number of resources to help. Far from what I envision as the ideal college setting, but for what its purpose is, I'm impressed. For my purposes though, it's just not what I want to see."
"Everyone is super cool and there are a ton of class options and majors, as well as minors. Plus the study abroad program is amazing."
"I transfered to the University of Kansas after my sophomore year and I was very nervous because it was a larger campus compared to what I was use to. Everyone on campus was very helpful when trying to find buildings and the professors were very welcoming and understanding of the shock from coming from a Community College. The administrative staff have been extremely helpful with answering any questions throughout my time here at KU and if they do not know the answer, they do a great job of pointing me in the direction to get the answer."
What I liked about the University of Kansas is the atmosphere of feeling like I belonged. Everyone on the campus is helpful and is willing to help you succeed. Each academic program that is based off certain majors are encouraging. Resources are available all across the campus and are willing to help one succeed with their major.
"I really enjoy how friendly the atmosphere it has, and how open the campus is. It exposes you to different scenarios which is great. It would be nice if we had more diversity on campus."
My experience at the University of Kansas has been great. The campus is beautiful. It has a lot of historical values like the train horn that signals the late bell. Also the people are great it is a family atmosphere. Everyone who works for the campus is put in place to help you succeed.
"I went to a campus visit and college fair at the University of Kansas couple of times. I love the environment, diversity, campus, local areas, mostly everything about the university. I would like to attend there to get a bachelor's degrees and major in Nursing. I also know the University of Kansas offers great scholarships and study abroad programs. I like the University overall, but I would like it even more if they offer more small class sizes."
The University of Kansas is an interesting university compared to others. It is diverse but separated by our up bringing which creates tension. Also the university lacks in its ability to help students in general because it is clear they only care about the money. The University of Kansas is an extremely fun place to go to school and it is a very good place to discover your self and acquire a degree. But in the end its just like any other college that is scamming it students for the money they've worked so hard to get so far.
What I really like about the University of Kansas is how nice everyone is. The professors are understanding and work with you to do the very best you can. I also really like the campus and how easy it is to move around on foot. You don't have to take a bus to get from one side of campus to the other side.
An overall positive experience so far with an inclusive atmosphere. A little concerned with the upcoming change in gun rules on campus as people will soon be allowed to concealed carry. Mrs. E's dining hall a little subpar. Seems to not be able to handle the crowd during rushes. Diverse class options so there should be not trouble finding a set of classes that challenge and interest you.
"I'm a current freshman at KU and I don't think I have ever felt more at home than on the hill. KU is such a welcoming community. I have been able to find ""my people"" which has helped me feel more comfortable with being an out-of-state student."
"I feel very comfortable with the University of Kansas. I have many friends who teach at the university, and I am able to interact with them and see what the college is life. I enjoy campus, and the many friendly faces. The athletic programs are constantly involved in the community, and KU athletes are always welcome around town. the facilities are aging, but the university is pouring lots of money into renovations, and everything is very clean."
"What I love about the University of Kansas is that the student life, and the atmosphere of campus. I love how I am able to meet many new people easily and love the busy atmosphere of the campus. Compared to other campuses, I noticed that it is a rather busy campus with a lot of events happening. Something that I don't like is the price of the university, and the lack of diversity. As someone of asian descent, I have heard some racially issues comments. But overall, the campus is rather liberal and that's another aspect I enjoy."
"Transfer student...Overall great college experience, top notch education and advisors are always very helpful. Lots of resources and help."
"The University of Kansas is a very good college and is very diverse. The college has great programs and even has their own Law School and Medical School. They have a very great staff of professors and provide a lot of information and guidance for incoming freshman and even for graduate students. My favorite thing about this college is that it has a career help center for students. It really is helpful if you do not know anything about what you want to do. They give different scenarios and examples of work environments, examples of hours they work, and much other important information into helping you figure out the perfect career path you are looking for."
"I love it here! The people are amazing, the school is involving and fun, and Lawrence is a busy, beautiful town."
"Greek life seems to be very prominent on campus. Though there are other clubs, greek life students seem to be involved in everything and are very to themselves making it hard for nongreeks to meet people. I love the academics and professors, but socially if you don't like greek life I would not suggest KU. The dorms are good, except you get what you pay for. The cheaper dorms (Oliver) are so much worse than the newer/more expensive dorms. Mrs. E's food is good, there seems to be little to no diversity, KU basketball is a fun event if you're into sport event, and I feel very safe on the beautiful campus."
"I love my professor and the School of Music is GREAT. The parking is AWFUL, which is why I'm giving the school 4 stars, and there isn't a lot of cohesive introduction for grad students."
The opportunities in future careers that you have by getting a degree from this school are amazing.
I was very impressed by the classes at this school. Some classes are pretty big but mostly the classes are decently small. I like this because its easier for me to get the material and ask questions.
The campus is very safe. The campus police are always patrolling and watching out for people so that no one is in danger.
I enjoy the dorms quite a bit. I like that its come as you please and theres no one telling me when i have to be home.
I didn't get to get join a frat.
The football team might not be that good but the games are fun and the basketball is really good.
I love it here. the people are great and are very nice.
Lawrence is cute and fun little college town. Midwestern hospitality is definitely seen here which makes it feel more like home. Professors are always willing to help you any way they can
"I'm a sophomore at KU and I have yet to be offered a job that works with my schedule. My freshman year I applied at the campus daycare and I never received a call back. This year I applied to three jobs and I just now got a call back from one of the jobs that I applied for in person last week. I've learned that online application don't work, even though KU constantly asks for online applications. The application process also takes about 30 minutes just to apply for one job. So to sum it up apply for on campus jobs takes too long when you have expenses that need to be covered now, and even if you take the time to apply it takes them forever to get back to you."
"There will always be bad teachers that easily ruin your experience with a subject, and trust me I've had them. They're terrible at grading, checking their emails, and honestly just awful at teaching... resulting in bad grades that reflect poorly on me. But I've also had a fair share of great teachers. They're funny, interesting, understanding of your situation, and always willing to help. So I would say my experience so far would be half & half. I've had as many bad teachers as I have good. And I've heard from many sources that that is ""lucky"" which I believe shouldn't be the case. We should have more goof teachers on campus, and If that's too much to ask for maybe we should have more TA's willing to help when the teacher is not."
"The main security on campus is great. My dorm room was never broken into last year, and the car I have this year has yet to be broken into. I use to take late night campus runs and I guess I was conscious about my surroundings, but i never felt completely unsafe. Going out is a completely different story. I almost always go out with guy friends that I trust because sexual assault is a prominent issue on campus. A girl in my Anthropology class was roofied just last week. I will never go out by myself, and I feel like that's an issue. I shouldn't have too worry as much as I do, and I do wish that would change on campus."
"Some of the dorms on campus are fantastic. They look amazing, and I've heard the experience with them is excellent, but the price is steep. Since I'm struggling with money I picked the cheapest dorm (4,000) for the year and it was awful. Community bathrooms were always filthy, my room was a small box that I shared with another girl, the dining hall in my dorm was disgusting (I ate frosted flakes every other day because of it). I also was sick a majority of the year due to the germs lying around the dorm (I had strep twice that year). So to sum it all up KU offers great dorms if you can afford the steep price, but if you can't... you're screwed."
"Greek life seems great. Personally I would love to join but the cost is too much. Many Greeks are exclusive. They sit in packs in class, and it's considered weird if you ask to sit by them. If you're not a Greek, you can't be associated with the Greeks. They seem to do a lot of work for the community, but they are mostly known for their parties. Housing for them is great, but there are more ""bad"" sororities than ""good""; and this is based on their ethics. Some really focus on academics and being involved, while others focus on appearances and parties."
"Basketball is crazy here. Everything revolves around it. Students are willing to skip class and camp just to get good seats at the game. It's crazy, but it's crazy fun for sure."
"Most teachers are there to help, but the way they help a student is not always beneficial. Some tend to go on tangents about one topic, wasting an hour of your time. Some are very helpful, they believe there is no such thing as a dumb question and I appreciate that because it makes me more comfortable with learning new information. Another flaw with many teachers is that they forget I'm taking 5 classes. They believe I have all the time in the world to work on their assignments and properly study for their tests, when in reality I don't; simply because my other classes ask too much from me."
the campus is an extremely liberal campus and you are looked down if you are not a liberal.
"I love going to the school, just wish it was more affordable and the price would stop going up for classes"
personally not in one and don't care to be in one.
everyone is extremely nice and helpful when it comes to finding things.
"Although I just finished my first week of college, I believe that Kansas University is a great campus and college to attend. The atmosphere is very friendly and kind"
I have enjoyed my time at KU. I wish it was not so cliquey with the greek life and more engaging so that you had more opportunities to make friends
There aren't a lot of careers in animation in Kansas but I'm willing to explore my options.
I feel really happy that I get to attend KU. I enjoy the freedom I have to explore my educational and career options and love being on campus.
"I feel relatively safe on campus, there are plenty of blue light centers about so if I ever feel in danger I have a resource to contact the police."
"I don't live on campus, but the buildings seem nice."
I'm not apart of the Greek life at school but they seem to provide a charitable and friendly atmosphere to our college.
I don't attend any athletic events so I can't speak for the athletic department.
KU is a very diverse and exciting campus and offers a variety of opportunities and fun experiences to help me with my degree.
The school is prideful on their alumni having some come speak to the class about their experience and how they got the job they worked hard for to achieve. Most corporate businesses have a KU alumni which helps students.
Courses are hard but the instructors are awesome people who go far and beyond to help you be successful.
Never heard about to much crime happening on campus but i walk late nights from the library and the recreation feeling totally safe.
Living on campus is pretty cool with all the events that happens on campus and meeting new people.
Greek life is definitely seen around campus with some charity events that they do which is pretty cool when they get they whole campus involved.
With having one of the best basketball programs in division one college sports it plays a huge part in the school spirit around campus.
I truly love my university there is nothing in the world that could compare to the experience i received with hanging out with the most outstanding people to being taught by the most helpful and experience professors.
I have never had a professor I did not love. All of the professors are very passionate about what they do and only want to see their students succeed. All of my classes were under 200 students. The professors will do anything to help you.
The professors will go above and beyond to help you find a job/intern. KU is very big on their alumni and bring them into classes and workshops to have students talk to.
It is a big campus so everyone should be aware of their surroundings. KU has many safe programs to make students feel safe on campus.
"I lived in the brand new dorm, so dorm life was great. I wished that the floors would have been more of a family like instead of staying to themselves. I think a good RA could have helped a lot with that. It is a walk from campus but a very nice location."
Greek life is a large part of campus. Almost all sororities and fraternities have houses on campus. Non-Greek members only support Greek life on campus.
"I see student athletes in class every day. They are not treated any different in the classroom. Of course, they are praised by the students around campus."
"Even though it is a massive school, I feel like a big family with students and staff."
"Pretty much if you're not a basketball player, don't expect anyone to know who you are. Everyone loves to go to the football games for the first half even though we lost every game this past season. And of course there's absolutely nothing like going to a KU basketball game."
"I could not imagine going to any other school. Even though it's quite expensive compared to some of the other schools around but every school is pretty pricey. I love the scholarship halls on campus, that really cuts down costs while still having the opportunities of living on campus!"
I love my Professors so far and the class sizes are smaller than I expected. I'm pursuing studying abroad next year and they are extremely supportive.
I'm required to spend one semester in an Internship Program with my Degree and the college assists you in placing you in an Internship of interest to me.
The Campus is Well Lit and is very safe to walk around. The Campus police are very visible and do their very best to provide a safe environment and protect our community.
I'm living in the SAE Fraternity house as a Freshman and could not have picked a better Fraternity. I enjoy spending time with my brothers and reaching out to help the community. I always believe that an individual should be giving and that was part of my selection process. The Greek Life at KU is big but includes everyone.
I was previously the Captain of the Varsity Football Team at my High School. I am one of the most competitive people that you could ever meet. I consider this a large part of my college experience and feel very satisfied with my college selection.
Love the SAE house that I just pledged to this summer.
Professors are experts and seem interested in what they are teaching. Some are better than others at providing opportunities to work with the students.
A school this size has many students interested in internships so it can be competitive but many are available.
There are dark places on campus and I hear stories of parties that lead to unwanted sexual contact but that happens without preparing.
Dorm life is remote and not much near the halls. People are the best thing about living on campus.
The basketball team is insane. Huge blast to get involved spectating and even going to the gym is easy and clean.
KU is a very large school but has many opportunities to get involved. Classes can run big but great overall in discussions and engagement.
The alumni network is amazing! Also KU is seen as a great school to have a degree from.
I have loved most every class I have taken and had amazing experiences learning.
"I feel very safe on campus, but know to be careful."
Student housing was a great way to make friends and also a way to get a job through the school.
Greek life at KU is a great way to get involved in the school and the community.
We have amazing athletic programs and support. The University of Kansas has always had so much fan support and school spirit for our athletic programs.
"The University of Kansas has provided so many opportunities to its students. We have awesome professors who make themselves available to students and many resources including help at libraries, TAs and office hours. We also have amazing study abroad programs. There are so many clubs and organizations available as well that provide awesome experience for future life skills."
I knew that KU was the place for me after meeting with Vanessa Delgado and Mike Swann. Those two are easily the best conversations I had during my college search.
"I love KU, there could be some improvements made to aspects of the schooling. The classes are sometimes too large and the style of teaching could be more involving. Other than that, the courses and professors are pretty great."
There are a good amount of job opportunities if you're willing to put in the effort and search for them.
More could be done to prevent sexual assault on campus.
I loved the environment and being surrounded by friends all the time.
I feel like greek life is centered around the wrong motives.
"Athletics are huge at KU, especially the basketball team. There is tons of school pride that comes from it."
I absolutely love KU. There is a very diverse community there and tons of learning opportunities. I can't even imagine being anywhere else at this point in time.
"On campus me and my friends feel very safe during the day and night, police are always going around making sure everything is good."
The courses are okay they all differ depending on what you are studying.The teaches are very good they are willing to help you out whenever you need it.
The career prospects look good from what I have seen and heard around from people on campus.
"While living in the dorms can be a hassle its one the best things that can happen to you, you make so many great friends while living in the dorms."
"While greek life is big on campus, most people really down care what fraternity or sorority you are in everyone is okay with all the greeks."
"Although KU football isn't the best, it doesn't matter sense we have KU basketball and volleyball two of the best teams in the nation."
My overall experience so far has super awesome I didn't think that I would like my school so much. Definitely would tell my friends to apply and com to KU!
"I never have class late at night, most of my classes are out by 7pm, so when I leave it's still daylight. I can't say that I have ever felt unsafe though, as there are safety and security measures taken that are easily accessible on campus. I also have the security office phone number in my phone and protective measure on my person, like key chain mace, if I ever find myself in an unfortunate situation. I think there is only so much a campus can do, and you need to be aware of your surroundings as well to make sure you keep yourself as safe as is possible."
"I'm still relatively new, so I can't really speak for the alumni network or even internship or job projects. I have been introduced to the career center/services and that has been pretty helpful, but I mainly checked it out to see what it was and what they offered. However, I do plan to utilize a lot of these services as I progress down the road to Physical Therapy, as I believe they will be an incredibly helpful resource."
"I am not really into Greek life, I have never been interested in it. I never pay attention to those who are a part of Greek life or think anything highly of them. I have noticed that some people who are a part of it, tend to think they are better than others, which is ridiculous. But that's a college campus for you, and you can choose who you want to associate with."
"The sports at KU, no matter what it is, always seem to bring everyone together. Even if you aren't a big sports fan, like me, you still get really sucked into the excitement and joy from everyone else when it comes to rooting for your school. The energy is infectious."
"I have been at a community college for the better part of 4 years, so KU has been my first university experience. I have yet to be disappointed by the campus, students, and professors. I have never felt more accepted or like I could comfortably talk with any of the faculty without being met with some kind of resistance like I have experienced before at prior schools. My experience here has been amazing so far, and I can only hope it continues throughout my college career while at KU."
Every professor I've had at KU has been knowledgable and skilled in their professions. They know what they're talking about and they want to give you the best education possible.
"I typically feel safe walking by myself on campus, but I get nervous late at night because there are occasional reports of muggings and attacks. Sexual assault in correlation with Greek life is a big issue for KU, and has even made national headlines in recent years. It doesn't worry me because I take proper precautions, but it could happen to anyone."
"I've never been to a frat party at KU, but they aren't talked about very often. KU partying is much more bar and house-oriented, because everything downtown is in such close proximity."
"KU is notorious for having a horrible football team, so you'll never see a crowd at Memorial stadium. What we lose in football, though, we make up in basketball. We have THE best basketball team in the nation and it's a huge part of our campus culture."
"Professors are friendly and knowledgable, there are countless clubs and organizations to be involved with, and the campus is breathtaking. KU is simply a great place to be. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
The party scene is fun without being dangerous
Safebus is great and runs from thursday to saturday
Workload is heavy-just what you would expect for college classes.
The campus is very diverse and accepting of minorities
Policy enforcement is pretty lenienent. Most students drink and party
Class variety was great. I liked all my different classes and my teachers were helpful
"The value of a degree from KU is very high, especially in nursing"
I feel very safe on campus. I will feel even safer once I am able to conceal and carry
Living in the dorms is a great option for first year students. There are always people around willing to answer your questions. I lived in Ellsworth. The dorms were nice and clean when we moved in and we were able to make our room home-like over the course of the year. Living in the dorms is a great opportunity to meet new friends and is an overall unique experience.
"As a non-Greek student, I don't know much about the Greek life here on campus. They live in beautiful houses and are known for their parties that draw in a lot of people. Greek students are often seen as partiers and aren't really taken seriously by their non-Greek peers."
"The school spirit at KU is unreal, especially during basketball season. Students will go to extreme measures to get good seats and tickets in the Phog. The basketball team nearly always leaves Allen fieldhouse with a win, and the players are friendly and like to get involved with the fans. The atmosphere at basketball games is very exciting and the students feed off eachother's energy."
"My first at the University of Kansas was amazing. What makes my school unique is the always friendly atmosphere and the caring professors and students.Everyone is able to rally together whether it's to support other students or the talented basketball team. I love its beautiful campus and the city of Lawrence. While the costs are extreme and overwhelming for me at times, I would choose KU all over again for the people I met this year and the challenging education I recieved."
My School is a very good medical school. The students there are very nice and the teachers are always there to help! I love Kansas University and I wouldn't Want to go anywhere else.
"The professors are very knowledgable about the topic they teach and I get very interested in my classes due to this. I like that my schedule has a variety of lecture types, ranging from 500 students to 20 students."
We have the best basketball team and the fan base is fantastic! Basketball truly brings the Jayhawk family together.
"I feel safe whenever I'm walking around campus, even if I'm alone or it's dark outside."
"The professors from this school are truly the most knowledgable people I've ever met! The staff and many resources this school provides really helps shape a plan to succeed in my career path. When I achieve my doctorate, even if it's not from KU, people will see my undergraduate degree and know I worked hard to get it. A degree from the University of Kansas definitely means something, plus the study body and alumni are more of a family than anything."
It's fun when you are a freshman
Basketball is something the entire school can bound on
The nightlife is very fun in Lawrence
I've enjoyed the parties I've attended
I've learned a lot in my classes
It's a very diverse campus. I like it
I think drugs are prevented
They do the best the can to prevent it from happening
I think there's a lot of opportunities in my field
I've enjoyed my classes her so far
I'm fortunate to be in the new dorm on Daisy hill Self hall. It's awesome! No ones lived here before so it's brand new and it's very nice
I'm very glad I am part of the Greek community. I love my house and have met lots of people from all over the country.
It's pretty good. It's not brand new like the University of Missouri but it's nice and has proper equipment and enough space to exercise.
I am so glad I attend the University of Kansas! It is rich in tradition and I love Lawrence. I've grown up going to football and basketball games here as my dad attended KU and now my brother and I do.
The school have a lot of confidentiality when it comes to the suspect so its hard to feel safe because you're not sure who's doing it or what's being done. It seems that the victims end up leaving and we don't hear anything about the suspect
"I've had some great professors here and some not so good. However, I have had more good classes than bad"
"Networking is pretty hard because it's not made so available, you kind of have to hunt for it. I wish it was made more available."
"So far, most of the dorms I lived in were old but because the people were so nice, it made it pretty fun."
I'm not too knowledgable about greek life but it seems that they do a lot
"I'm personally not into sports, but everyone else here is very crazy about them."
"It's okay, but since I started my education here, I plan on finishing. It is a great first school however I don't think it was for me personally. But school is school, it doesn't matter where you go, it's about what you do there and I have accomplished quite a bit at this institution and I'm thankful for it."
It could be worse but it is a very safe campus and they look out for all of us the best that they can.
There are many ways to get an job/internship here and the university does a great job with helping you find one.
My overall experience here has been amazing! I like that most of my classes are smaller which allows for more one on one with professors and students.
"It could be worse but it's okay, there haven't been any safety issues that I have had to deal with so I feel very safe here."
"I am not a part of Greek life at my school nor would I ever be, it's just not for me."
"Our athletic department here at KU is really good, the only problem is that I don't think they give the same amount of attention to the academics as they do the sports."
"My overall experience here at KU has been the best experience of my life. I enjoy my classes, professors, and the atmosphere here at KU. I would love to do it all over again if I could."
"I feel safe on campus, but it's always safer to walk around on campus with someone else or in a group after dark."
Any issues I've had have been minor and they've been addressed to my satisfaction. The advisors and professors in the School of Education have been inspiring and helpful.
"I'm only a Freshman, so I'm not sure."
"The AC, heat and humidity need to be controlled better in Lewis Hall."
Delta Gamma is the best house with girls who really care about each other and the community we serve. Academics are a high priority.
KU basketball is the best in the country and other sports are great as well.
I love KU because of the excellent academic atmosphere and phenomenal extracurricular opportunities including Greek Life and sporting events. The campus is absolutely beautiful and I feel safe walking to class on campus.
"i feel relatively safe on campus but crimes are bound to happen, KU takes these seriously and always has services available to assist with these"
Campus courses have a wide variety to match your major or interests.
getting a degree from KU is a great honor and it looks great on a resume
"living on campus is super convenient and you are able to get to know your peers better. Living on campus means you are closer to everything. Depending on the doorms you live in, rooms can be a little small but manageable"
I am personally not associated with the Greek Life but they are always having fundraisers and are a big part of campus. If your a non-Greek you aren't looked at differently. People in sororities and fraternities seem like family.
"Even though our football team isn't that good, people still show up and show their support. We have a lot of school spirit and when it comes to basketball we get super excited because we are one of the best."
The whole environment is positive and everyone is friendly and great. Your professors and advisers are there to help you succeed. It is easy to get involved in things you like and you succeed a your own pace.
I have always had a good advisor as well as good teachers who are there to help
I get plenty of emails advising me of all the opportunities out there.
I feel safe at the Edwards campus
I moved here from Colorado so this was my best option at a good education in KS.
The Jayhawks are highly respected and fans are everywhere. You cant attend this school and not care about the team!
Everything I could ever imagine and more.
Best parties are no parties. I would stay home any night of the week over going out. Bars are the best because at the vary least they have some security. I prefer to go to the Eldridge because that's where the adults are. Brothers is where you go if you want to get an STD. Almost everything else is a townie bar or brothers on a small scale.
"Academics are what you make of them just like the entire college experience. However, professors have the ability to limit your experience. Meaning that if you notice one professor teaches several courses in your degree program, you aren't getting variety and will start to notice that occasionally they have no clue what they are talking about. You BS your homework and they can BS the lectures. Some professors are really good though. Do your research and don't take a class because it is ""easy"". That will hurt you in the long run. Take a class because the professor rated well."
"I'm constantly exposed to people who's views, opinions and backgrounds differ from mine and it is amazing. This school is the center of the salad bowl."
"If you get into drugs, you won't graduate and will be sucked into the ever growing population of people who live on New Hampshire on front porches. Drugs are easy to access and the ecstasy is meth. Again, ecstasy here is METH. Stick to marijuana if you want to try something new. The amount of people who live in the community center and have to get free mental health services because they burned out is overwhelming. They come from all over because the program for homeless is so accepting. So basically you are exposing your self to the worst criminals and drug dealers in Kansas/Missouri if you buy from anyone."
The availability of employment after graduation is what you would expect. I got a good useable degree but employment is competitive and unless you spent 4 years kissing your professors asses don't expect to get a position with a popular employer.
My classes at JCCC were better. I learned more and was better prepared by the professors at Johnson county. I would not take all your credits at KU get the cheaper credits at JCCC and get exposed to what learning is supposed to look like. KU prepares you well for the real world but the courses are dull and unenjoyable until you get into your degree program. Professors are self centered and typically do a lot of talking about things unrelated to class material. Don't hesitate to tell a professor off in the middle of class because they will absolutely do the same to you.
If you are an attractive female you will get raped if you try going out even once. The men here are creepy as they come and when they drink they are the most insufferable and vile things.
"Don't live on campus outside of freshman year for the experience. Consider having an off campus apartment your freshman year to avoid the hassle of parking, odd smells and rude staff."
"Greek life is ruining our campus. They are your TA, they let you in at the gym and are given power over pretty much everything. For a campus promoting it's diversity greek life gets shoved down our throats too much."
I wouldn't go to this school. If I were a high school senior starting all over KU would not even be on the list of options.
Almost everyone gets involved in athletics at some point. There are many options for involvement and diverse offerings of times and activities.
"The department doesn't offer an many courses as I would like, so there isn't much to choose from. Despite this, they try to accommodate whenever possible and create solutions.

Many professors don't have the best language skills or pedagogy."
"Everybody ends up getting a job. It may not be their dream job, but I believe we will work up to it."
"As a GTA I got training on how to deal with situations regarding my students, and I am glad I know what to do and where to go if I find myself in set situation"
"The program is good and the small department has its advantages. I didn't really apply to enough schools, so I could have probably gotten into a better one. If I don't take this into account, I am happy to be living here. The town is Great!"
"The Student Rec Center is absolutely amazing. The availability of Fitness classes, multiple sports to choose from, flexible hours, great facilities, awesome instructors and trainers. Is everything you dream of."
"I feel very safe on campus, however, more lights around campus that come on at night would greatly increase how safe I feel after walking home from the library late at night."
all of my professors really care about what they are there to do: teach me everything they know as best as they can. I appreciate how passionate all my professors have been and how willing they are to talk to me if I do not understand something.
"I have not really began attempting to get an internship on campus yet, however there seem to be plenty of resources and professionals that are more than willing to help me when that time comes."
"I live in one of the more run down, older dorms but despite smaller rooms and some of the facilities breaking more often than other dorms, the community in Oliver Hall is very strong and makes it all worth it."
"Although Greek life may get a bad reputation across the country, at University of Kansas Greek life plays a large role in the community and the kids in greek life are fun and friendly, despite your status in greek life."
Jayhawk basketball is some of the best in the country and everyone supports the team and lives the game together.
"Although Kansas may get have a bad reputation as bland, flat and a state not even worth thinking about the University of Kansas is the shining jewel of this state. The people have shown me what it is truly like to respect and lift up all those around you, the academics and professors have given me the opportunity time and time again to excel and it truly this place has become home."
"Really easy to apply, straightforward interview day."
Would recommend KU Med to anyone
"I feel safe most of the time. I wish the busses had longer hours, though."
"I have not finished my freshman year, so I am still learning my way around the availability of jobs, etc."
I live in a great dorm with plenty of room. There are interesting people up and down the halls.
I just joined a sorority and I love it.
There is great school spirit! Rock Chalk!
"I am only in my second semester, but I love it here!"
"I am a very small person (under 5 foot) and as a rule I don't walk far by myself, but I don't ever feel like I am in danger in this school."
I love the challenge of the courses and how professors aren't afraid to make it hard.
It is a well respected institution with great alumni networking and a great career center.
"If you like people, the dorms is the place for you."
"I am not a part of Greek life, but I hear good things."
I love it and it sets me up well for my future!
"I absolutely love KU. I am a cheerleader, so I represent and praise the school on a daily basis. My only complaints are how large the class sizes are, but I understand that's what comes of attending a large school. Rock Chalk!"
The school is pretty safe for being such a big campus. I wish there were more street lights.
The school of music helps students find jobs post graduation quite frequently; especially music therapist.
The professors are all friendly and accommodating.
I don't live on campus. I live at home so I wouldn't know.
I am not a part of greek life and am not terribly affected by it.
The school seems to have a lot of school spirit and basketball is crazy.
I love studying music therapy at KU and have no complaints.
"By far the best part of this school, our basketball team is one of the best in the country"
KU has had a lot of issues with racism and discrimination lately
"Greek life is very intense here and often overwhelming, but there's practically no social scene her outside of Greek Life soo..."
"I am going to say that though the application process is easy--still, I will digress to my last statement I made earlier in this survey."
"They have great athletic facilities, but that is because they put so much money into them. They make it obvious that they care more about their sports teams than education. This can be easily noticed by how much money the school allocates to their sports programs and facilities. Granted I understand that a University really should say ""I am a business"", and thus they put more money into the areas where they get more out of their investment. But still, they could at least try a little bit to care about education. The whole research school thing is kind of a smoke screen because it mainly relies on what seems to be the top players in the medical, chemistry, and biology departments and isn't a very good representation of the ""research school"" aspect as a whole."
"It's pretty safe on campus, just keep walking and don't wonder too much"
"I really like college at KU the professors are much better this semester than what I had last semester, and I'm figuring everything out. The quality of courses are challenging and I really like it."
Businesses would rather you come to them than you try and get a job when they come to campus.
I live in the new dorms and it's really good. I'm just rating on the other dorms which are old and not very nice at all
I don't care for it and would rather it not be apart of college
Basketball Heck yes!!!! Amazing experience and something not to ever miss!!!!
"It's very expensive, and I'm having a hard time paying for college, but the experience is amazing and I love it"
There have not been many major the problems on campus. The main ones that I can think of is that a few cars had been broken into but they found the guy and also there was a fraternity problem but that got figured out as well. There are help buttons located all around campus if you feel like you need the KU police to come and help you so walking around campus even at night is perfectly safe.
So far my professors have been great! They are easy to work with and great at teaching their subject. There is one professor that is kind of difficult for freshman level biology but after you get the hang of the class it becomes very easy.
There are tons of job and internship opportunities on campus you just have to attend the events around campus. The career center/services is great they helped me find many places to volunteer that would help to provide a solid career opportunity in the future.
"Generally, I feel that KU offers many services to support a healthy campus."
KU has caring and talented professors and the classes are challenging and interesting.
There are lots of events that help with career planning and explore possibolities with majors.
I've made some lifelong friends!
"For the most part, includes great people."
KU basketball is kind of a big deal.
"I love it here! People, atmosphere, and education. Great school."
The dorms are fantastic. My floor is very outgoing and I have gained a lot of friends from the social gatherings offered to the floor. The options are also great because there are cheaper options and more expensive options in the the dorms and also the rooms also vary from 4 person suites to single person rooms. The cost is very nice considering it also includes a dining plan and the cleaning service is very good at their job.
I am personally a non-Greek but I have many friends that are Greeks. Greek life has a good affect on the social atmosphere on campus. Not only do they have good parties but they also have great community events where they volunteer their time to help the community. Greek students in my opinion are just like every other student except they have commitments to their house and the community that take up some of their time. There are all sorts of Greek housing opportunities. They have large houses and small houses and they are located all around lawrence.
"The student involvement especially in basketball is huge. I have never seen so many people get so hyped and wait as many hours for a game as some of my fellow students. Also the KU sport teams are very good so watching them and cheering for them is worthwhile because we win a lot of the games we play in. The athletic facilities are fantastic, they are well kept and up to date equipment."
My favorite experiences is meeting new people everyday. Since the school is so large there are many different types of people that you can meet and everyone I have met so far has been very friendly. KU is very unique in the way that they are able to have various class sizes and even in the largest classes you are able to get one on one time with your teacher or TA's. I would choose KU again any day because of the experiences I have had while going here and the people I have met. The education that I have received has been very worthwhile because not only do they teach in a way that is easy to understand but they are also able to teach a lot of information in a small amount of time.
I don't feel threatened while on campus. I also think that the campus does a good job to keep us safe.
I feel like a lot of kids come here to get an education from a good school
No place I'd rather be
It's an awesome chance to meet new people.
They have a bad overall view.
Coming here was one of the best decisions of my life. Not only are the people I met completely awesome but the teachers here are so helpful. Everyone here has a great outlook on life and it helps that we're all Jayhawk fans!
Safety and security is okay but there's always more that could be done
Teachers want their students to succeed
Career services are helpful and easy to get a hold of
"Housing was pretty good, rooms were okay sizes"
Sporting events are the best part of going to KU
Love the campus and people I've met.
There have been multiple thefts and a few suspicious people and gunmen. This is one area where I wish I could see some improvement.
Professors are very accommodating in almost every class. They are very engaging and help with anything you need
There are always internships and jobs readily available to apply to and our alumni network is very active and helpful.
I live in Lewis and my experience has been great! A few thefts but as long as you always keep your door locked it's fine.
I am a Tri Delta and it has been the best experience of college so far!
KU Basketball is the best in the nation!
I love KU! Couldn't imagine myself anywhere else.
"Im in the beginning of my program so i havent looked much into career prospects yet, although it does sound like the athletic training program has a lot of intership opportunities available to the students that make it through the program."
"The big science classes, the important ones every student has, has only one class time for the almost 1000 students that need to take it. How is any student expected to learn when we arent treated as students but treated more like livestock in a slaughter house?"
"Nothing special, i see campus police drive around campus but i never see any out of their cars. Ive notice a surprising lacking number of security cameras inside of the classrooms/class halls."
Greek life isnt something im around too often but various experiences with random frat or sorority members has given me a negative emotion toward them. The men act high and mighty and the women refuse to hold a conversation.
The main reason i like the school so much is because of the friends I've made here. If i didn't have these friends i don't think i'd be enjoying my college experience.
"Football is embarrassing to watch, Basketball is the only good sport here and currently the team is struggling"
Watkins is really annoying to go to cause there is always a line but there are plenty of other resources in lawrence if you are sick. In regards to safety we could probably use more police poles (the blue light up things) but honestly theres usually security/police around and its not really unsafe.
There's obviously been times where school has been tough and I've wanted to quit. But all professor I've experienced have been very welcoming and supportive and love their jobs and subjects. The sizes are fine cause I'm not picky about that and it all depends on which course it is. Overall I don't mind going to school.
"Almost everyone I know, and I'm a sophomore has had/or is getting an internship within the past year and there is an abundance of resources for you to chose from."
"I lived in Naismith and I don't believe it could have gone better. I don't think any dorm is ever truey going to be perfect, except the new ones on daisy hill. But it did the job."
"The only reason I wouldn't rank Greek Life as great is because of our Chancellor. She does not like greek life so it limits us is some respects. However, being a member of greek life I highly recommend it. Living in the greek houses is great and you meet amazing people. The greek community pushes you to be your best and we all work together and support each other when we need to."
I'm just gonna skip over out football because it's almost like it doesn't exist here except for tailgates. But our basketball is the polar opposite. Students continuously camp for game and were are constantly ranked some of the best in the country.
"There's no place on Earth like Lawrence. The atmosphere surrounding the school is extremely welcoming and really gets you excited about KU. KU is unique because I don't think any school comes together like the Jayhawk community. People are polite and school spirit is everywhere. Our school is one of those ""easy to get in, hard to stay in"" the professors care about their studies and I feel as if I'm actually learning. But it is in no way impossible. Work hard play hard is an understatement here. KU is one of the most underrate party school. And our BASKETBALL, is absolutely insane. If you weren't a fan, you will be. Rock chalk."
The safety and security on campus is very important.
My experience at the campus is very positive. The people are very frienship. I felll very happy in KU
The campus have variety the career. The employers are very competitive.
The housing are very clean and safe.
The Greek housing are not very available in University of Kansas
The sports are very important in the student community.
"My college is the best, the college town is place very safe. The university offers a variety of academic programs."
I like my college experience.
"watkins is known for not good diagnoses....skip it, go the minute clinic way"
The J school is the best school ON EARTH
"If you're in the j school, you're guaranteed a job post grad"
"I'm in the new dorms so they're fantastic, but I love living in a dorm"
I'm in greek life and it's made a huge difference in my academic and social life. I wouldn't have made it through the first semester without my sorority.
"there's nothing better than the KU atmosphere. best college, especially for the j school."
never seen an effort out towards it
Just not worth the money!
Thankful that I'm in a valued fraternity. Network from that is priceless
Too much revolves around greek
Academics are not worth the money. Students looking to get ahead are held back with all the others
I'd like to go to a school where pepper spray is not a necessity
the school is too focused on athletics
i don't think greek life now is what it was intended to be when they first started
a lot of school spirit
The school has a great community but I do not believe The cost of tuition reflects on the level of education
"It's KU. It's a big name, well-respected, and gets a lot of attention. It is also really big. In order to find your place here, you have to look for it. There's something for everyone though. It can be overwhelming, but once you take advantage of some of the options offered to you, you can make it the place you want it to be."
"There are a lot of things going on, but by the middle of the semester the frat parties die down and the school really becomes more of a bar scene. It can be fun, but repetitive. You really have to branch out to find house parties and smaller events."
"Lots of fun if you know where to go. It is very much a bar scene, which can be fun but also repetitive and expensive."
"I have felt challenged here but nothing was impossible to complete. When you get deeper into your major, the classroom environment gets better. Smaller classes make it easier to get to know your professor. I really love my program."
Lots of different kinds of people. Representation for minorities could be better though.
"Basically, you do what you want. I've only heard of a few instances of drug abuse. The ban on hard liquor in frat houses has made a big difference too."
"KU does an okay job with this, but not good enough. I always feel slightly uneasy walking home alone at night. I've heard rumors of shady things that have gone on in dorms. Living in a big building is frightening at times. You just have to be smart. The university will give you tips on how to take care of yourself and keep yourself safe, but you just really have to be on top of things. The campus police is good though and its nice knowing that they are always on the lookout. I'm just worried about what will happen if conceal and carry becomes reality in the future. As for health, our clinic is a headache in itself. You're better off going to the clinic at Walgreens."
"It's fine. Nothing spectacular but nothing much to complain about. I have a bathroom and shower in my room and that has been great. The new dorms are ridiculously nice but also very expensive. Also just know now that Oliver's dining hall is way worse than Mrs, E's on Daisy Hill."
"Personally, greek life has given me a place to call home and identify with. Recruitment wasn't easy though, and it is in its nature to make girls feel bad about themselves. Our recruitment counselors were great though and very helpful with the process. It definitely isn't for everyone though, and that's okay. It isn't a huge part of the school (only about 20%) but it has made me feel more connected with it and is a way to get involved and meet people."
"Yes, KU basketball is incredible, but because it gets so much attention it overshadows all the other sports. It is the best team we have and the games are unreal to witness, but it seems like no one really cares about the other sports."
"KU is huge. The campus is big, and there are so many different kinds of people. Anyone can find their place, but it may take time to do that. This is true at any state school. KU definitely stands out though. For starters, Lawrence is the perfect college town. It has everything you need: places to buy necessities, a cool downtown, fun locals, and things to do. It's a nice size and very welcoming to students. Also KU basketball is amazing. School spirit is everywhere and there is so much tradition."
"There is always cops patrolling campus, and call buttons if you feel unsafe walking around campus"
"The alumni network, and the career center at this school will help you get your resume out in the world."
The courses are what you would expect for the degree I am pursuing and every professor I have met is more than willing to help you out in whatever way they can.
It's very typical of what you expect dorms to be like
It's about the same at other universities that I have heard from
The town has lots of things to do while still feeling like a small town. Also everyone who works at KU is extremely helpful for whatever you need help with.
"depends on what building, Oliver is only good for the awesome people who live there, the building sucks"
"I'm not in greek life and have no desire to be, if you might be interested the are prominent"
"Obviously KU basketball is great, but feel like other sports are ignored"
"The health center is not as effective as it should be, both in physical and mental health areas."
We have good safety here
lots of people know KU
had 1 horrible professor bringing the score down
Most people see it as stereotypical Greek life
KU Basketball is the best in the country!
College is far better than high school!
"Being a guy, I feel pretty safe on campus. I've never felt unsafe."
I think I have taken many classes with great professors. Most of them have been nice and cared about my success in their class. I've liked many of the courses I've taken so far.
I think that my career prospects and the value of my degree are high because of KU.
"The dorms are okay, but that is what I expected. I liked the space in the rooms and thought it was nice to have the option of having a bathroom to yourself."
I love Greek life at my school. I belong to Sig Ep at KU and have met some great friends. I also believe our Greek Life is a way to join together and meet new people and have fun.
"Ku sports are a huge part of my school. We have a men's basketball team that has been one of the best for many years. We also have many other sports that are highly recognized like volleyball, track and field, softball, etc."
"I love going to KU and I've met a lot of great people. I've met friends that I will have for a long time, as well as people who are interested in my major."
Most of the classes on campus are pretty average. No new desks or chairs. Be aware most science based classes are very large and if you want any one on one with the professor you must meet with him/her during their office hours.
The University of Kansas has great degrees that can be applied to a variety of career fields and/or prepare you for post-graduate school. The School of Education is currently ranked #9 for best in the country! Strong academics = strong success!
Safety and security on campus have definitely improved over the years. There are plenty of safety boxes located around campus which will alert police you need help. There is also good lighting throughout the campus at night now!
"The dorms on Daisy Hill are for the most part pretty average, however they just built a new building which is incredibly nice. The new building is nicer than a lot of the apartments in the surrounding area. Not sure on pricing though.. but based off the older dorms the value of campus living is somewhat poor. Unless you're looking for the ""freshman experience"" an apartment will be better for the price."
Sororities are much better than fraternities. Frat guys abuse the fact that they're in a frat.. they're power trippers and most of them would otherwise not have friends if they weren't in a frat. Frats are viewed as a place for people to pay for friends. If you're into Greek life you'll have your Greek friends but most non-Greeks will talk behind your back.
"Overall the campus is awesome.. from academics to night life! There is also a lot of opportunities to get involved with extra curricular activities. If you're thinking about going, you won't be disappointed!"
Athletics at the University of Kansas are very big! Basketball is number 1 and football follows at number 2. Always a blast and the fans are incredible.. overall great school spirit.
"There are great instructors and there are duds, but I think you would have that anywhere."
I have felt safe on campus for the most part. I did have an instructor that gave exams from 8 to 10pm last semester and I always had a friend drop me off and pick me up rather than walk by myself at night. As a girl I think you just have to use common sense and be aware of your surroundings.
"Courses are challenging and class sizes can be big. If you don't ask for the extra help you will struggle. In big classes you are just a student number and professors won't reach out to struggling students it is up to you to go to them. My experience with Teachers Assistants has been mixed. One adequate but poor instructor, one that had a thick accent making it difficult to understand his lectures, and others that were very helpful for the supplement instruction time offered by my science classes."
Being a freshman I haven't used the career center yet. I want to be a physical therapist and I belive their job placement percentage after graduation is verynhigh.
I live in GSP. Location is great to get to campus quickly. Easy access to get in and out of town.
"There are 12 sororities, formal recruitment is a rough and exhausting week but worth it. I have been able to meet some really cool people through my Greek involvement. The upperclassmen have been helpful with selecting classes/professors, and giving guidance /tutoring in classes I'm currently taking."
Our football team is not so hot this year but basketball is great! Our volleyball team also made it to the final my this year.
I joined the marching band and immediately was surrounded by new friends that helped make a big university feel smaller. I also joined Greek life and that gave me another social group to help me feel like I had a support group as I adjusted to living away from home.
"I feel safe, but my friends on the other hand were scared of my roommate, and the things he said. But I'll feel more safe when 2017 rolls around and I can open carry around campus."
"It depends on the class. Biology, for example, had 900 kids, 2 professors, 14 TA's, and it was hard to learn. English, had about 20 kids, a TON of availability for office hours, and was one of the best classes my first semester of freshman year."
Most of my friends are the ones that live in the dorms.
"They have a reputation for sexual harassment, but once you get to know some of those that are in Greek Life, they're some of the coolest people I know. Like the Chi Omega Sorority helps to keep campus beautiful, and they added Chi Omega fountain, and it's one of the most beautiful things on campus."
"One word to be said. Basketball. The best in the Nation, and we're on our way to the top again."
"Although we suck at football, there's still a sense of community, and family, and there's a hope in the air that we might win. When homecoming rolls around, school goes crazy, and we all gather around and hope that we might pull through a victory. Traditions night is important, in learning how to ""wave the wheat"", see Big and Baby Jay, but most importantly, we get to learn the ominous, droning sound, of the ""Roooccckkk Chhhaaaalllllkkk, JaaaayyyyyHawwwwwkkkk, Kaaaaayy, Yoooooouuuuuuuu"". It's an amazing experience, and I wouldn't trade it for anything."
"Greek life is not for me, but for those into it, you will find a great atmosphere at the University of Kansas!"
"I love the University of Kansas, and hope to earn a Doctoral degree here!"
"Rock, Chalk, JayHawk, Go K U !!! Fear the Crimson Phog!"
"There's not a lot of hard drugs, but there's a LOT of alcohol and weed."
Best party school in KS!
The bars are the best. House parties are good. Frats aren't a lot of fun.
"There are a lot of white, spoiled kids from KC, but if you can avoid them, there's plenty of diversity."
Classes are challenging enough and there are a lot of options.
"Campus is a pretty safe place, as well as lawrence in general."
There are a lot of internships available for specific majors.
"I like that there is a lot of opportunities, but it's easy to get overwhelmed."
By far the best courses and professors of all my educational classes and professors.
Safety measures are all around
I have heard they are the best of the best.
"They are the best in making you feel comfortable, welcomed and ready to succeed!"
"It's nice, I just am excited to live off of campus."
"A few are okay, mostly cliquey jerks unfortunately."
Bro... KU basketball... That's all I'm going to say. It's amazing
"It's lots of fun, just a lot of work. Great college. Nothing huge I can say for it in praise, but nothing to dissapointed the school either."
"Honestly, for girls some environments are not safe."
"Dorms are great with the exception of Oliver Hall. However, they are very expensive so if you are a freshmen I'd strongly consider scholarship halls."
"There are a ton of opportunities but you have to diligently search for those opportunities if you want them. The professors can be very preoccupied with research and earning prestige which at times can compromise their efforts towards their classes. However, most of them are passionate about their study if they've been doing it for a while. Some popular study areas are engineering, education, business and health professions."
"Honestly, with the numerous reports of sexual assaults reported at fraternity gatherings, going to those functions seem sketchy for girls. For guys and girls, it mostly appeals to you if you're white. I don't know a lot of racially integrated Greek societies."
The best part of KU is the community I found in Lawrence through my church. These people really care and have had a huge impact on my overall college experience.
I live in a scholarship hall and I love it!
"I'm not involved in Greek life, so I don't have much to say."
KU basketball is the best!
"I love attending the University of Kansas. I know a lot of students feel as though they're lost among the masses at KU, but I don't!"
"With my original degree from KU, I could not get a job. With my second degree, I have always had the option of a job but not an ideal one. I do not anticipate this will change with continuing education rather I will have the option to get the job I want."
The courses are mostly good; general education classes leave something to be desired. The professors can range from great to worthless. The class size and styles are larger but learning still does take place.
There are multiple accounts of sexual assaults being swept under the rug and KU does not openly admit it and try to find a solution. So they happen again.
I never lived on campus and will continue this tradition as well.
I don't really bother with the Greek life at KU and will continue this tradition.
I certainly made a few mistakes through my undergrad and graduate schooling that has resulted in wasted time and effort that could have been avoided if I had had a good adviser.
The athletics department override many other departments on game day but it funds the school.
"I think it's okay because nothing has happened to me on campus yet. However, I've heard stories about things that have happened in the past year that haven't been addressed or taken care of. There's a solution but it seems like the campus doesn't want to deal with it because of how long is taking to replace a faculty member."
"Part of the reason I chose to go ahead and enroll at KU was because it is a well-known school and there is possibility the name benefits me in my career, which is in the sports industry. The Alumni are involved and want to help students find internships, jobs, and other career opportunities. They'll help you look at other schools for continuing education and share their experience, like a mentor would. The career center has been helpful in building resumes and creating cover letters, the writing center helps to edit those also."
"There's a lot of courses offered that can fulfill the KU Core requirements but students are not encouraged by professors to take them, my advisors haven't really pushed it either but your peers and friends will encourage you to if they've enjoyed it themselves. The TA's I've had haven't been helpful for me but I also wasn't in their faces asking questions all the time and they didn't really know me. However in discussion sections the TAs are able to get to know you and work with you a little more, but there was one time I asked a TA for help on a paper and he didn't even open my e-mail when I sent it (And he was expecting it). I don't feel like the big classes are priority because professors don't know the students or don't take time to connect with students, which I feel makes them unapproachable. Only your general education classes will be large classes with 400-990 students like Sociology or Biology."
"I've had roommate issues, but that's expected. I live in GSP (Gertrude Stellards Pearson) and it's convenient to live a little further from campus because it's a little more quiet, there's also a dining hall which is similar to Mrs. E's on the hill, and it's a nice walk to Jayhawk Blvd."
"I don't know much about Greek Life and how to participate in them. I've become a little interested in joining because it's like a little family where people help you, find help for you, look out for you and make sure you're okay in your academic life and personal life."
"The recreation center are one of the most popular places on campus, students go there all the time. The basketball team is extremely well known already but getting into a game seems a little bit more important to students than their classes."
The academics have been good and my academic advisors are extremely helpful. I've gotten close with a few upperclassmen enough to look at them as mentors and they have been helpful as well. There's a little lack in the social life off campus and there isn't much going on campus and if there is no one really knows about it as if it is a hush hush event.
"Workload is acceptable. Again, some professors are hard, some easy even though they teach the same class. Consistency should be addressed."
"I have never felt unsafe while on campus. However, I am a male so that could play a role."
"The professor you get has a surprisingly big effect on how your class will go. One professor could be really fun and engaging while another puts you to sleep. One may have ridiculous tests while the other is a walk in the park. Since it is the same class, I would have liked to see more consistency between difficulty and interest."
"I am in the Exercise Science program. They provide unpaid internships your final semester but that's it. Meanwhile, my engineering roommates get paid $15 an hour working internships every summer. It would be nice for them to offer career fairs like these other majors so students can get that experience and financial support."
"Not bad. Not great. Kind of depends on who you live with. Some people like to have fun, others do everything they can to limit your fun."
Frat guys are all the same. Sorority girls are all the same. If you aren't in a house they won't talk to you. They show off daddy's money like nobody's business and act like they did something to earn it. Really just makes you want to punch them.
Basketball is awesome. Always has been. But football team needs to improve. Enrollment and funding would likely be much greater with a competitive football team.
"Good exercise science curriculum. Allowed me to get into physical therapy school. I think some of the courses are very unrelated to the major, however."
"Choosing to attend the University of Kansas was a decision that I could not be more pleased that I made. If given the opportunity to choose all over again, I would absolutely still pick KU. The classes, in my experience, have been appropriately challenging while still being fun and enjoyable, and the teachers I've had are so supportive to their students and passionate about what they teach. Any advisers I've met with (undergraduate, major-specific, financial, etc.) were so kind and eager to help, as well as available and quick to respond when I had any questions. Overall, my academic experience here at KU has been top-notch."
"I love KU. Living in the scholarship hall is great too. It is an unique feature of KU, not many universities have them. It is like a dorm but it is only 50 other guys who also excel in school. I have met lots of new people and have good classes that make me study hard for. I am looking for a research opportunity right now."
I love the college which is due to my class experience and dorm experience.
"KU, despite being similar to most public state universities, has been a great place for me to grow throughout my college career. I love the school and since I lack the funds to afford to go out of state, it is my best option."
University of Kansas values their students receiving an education as much as their students receiving a degree.
"KU is very friendly at face-value, but not once you get any deeper into the University and its programs. Administration sees you as a number with a dollar value attached, not as a person; and if you slip up and have a semester of low grades, especially early on in your academic career, you will find no assistance from the University, they'll simply tell you, ""Good luck!"" as they push you out the door."
"My school has great traditions, along with a large list of courses/majors to choose from, lots of places to explore, and outstanding campus resources. The only problem I have with my school is that TA's teach most of the math classes I have taken, which turned into a struggle for understanding material taught."
"I love it here at KU so much. There is not a thing I would change about the quality of life or schooling here. Also, Lawrence is beautiful and it is a great college town and I feel right at home. It is my dream school and attending this university is like a dream come true every single day. We have so many amazing traditions and the best basketball team in the nation. I would choose KU every single time, no matter where I got accepted to. There is no other place in the world i would rather be."
"My first semester at KU my freshman year I fell in love with my school. The professors are extremely helpful, we have so many resources that are provided for us, and there's a place for everyone. Even though KU is a big school with a lot of students, KU is a very home-like place and once you're a Jayhawk, you've instantly become a part of another family. I feel so blessed that I get to KU and I wouldn't want to go to any other school."
"It is just really expensive, and I'm not happy with paying TA's to do the professors' work."
This is an alsome school because of the amount resources available to students on and off campus. This also a research university and I am very interested in that and that is why I am where I want to be. The professors are caring and very respectful to their students. Assignment becomes easier because professor makes it easier to understand. The University of Kansas has taught me sufficientcy and great achievaible knowledgeble. As a freshman of a first generation in my family my first year experience was great because I learn alot. It is worth it.
I've loved the opportunities that my school has set out for me. My advisor is always open to meeting me and my teachers check their emails constantly. The school spirit is extremely evident and the sense of community is warming.
What I love most about KU are the traditions.
"I haven't been here for very long yet, but it seems okay so far. No big complaints or praises."
I would choose University of Kansas again because it is like a hidden gem. Not many people know just how great of a school it really is.
Campus is beautiful and the academic programs really prepare you well for the workforce after college.
"I have had a great college experience so far. I have gotten extremely involved in the Catholic Campus Center and have loved it. As for classes, they have been difficult, but for the most part they have been enjoyable"
"I loved the diversity that the University of Kansas has to offer. I came to college without an idea of what I wanted to study or what I wanted to do after graduation. As I immersed myself in different student organizations, I was able to find my niche. I started off as a business major, and finished as a Community Health Education and Pre-nursing major. I became president of the Community Health Outreach Program and truly felt like I was able to make a difference in the health of our local community. Of course, you have to balance out studying and student organizations with having a good time. That is where KU basketball comes in! I never knew one sport could bring a student body together like basketball can. During the day, we are all students from different walks of life, studying different subjects. On game day, we are all one big Jayhawk family, waving the wheat and singing our alma mater as the Jayhawks bring home another win. There is no place like home. Home is the University of Kansas."
"KU is big but not too big, the sports are great (especially basketball), classes are not too hard and not too easy, the honors program isn't too hard, and there are many opportunities for gaining experience."
"I haven't yet begun school, but I'm eager to start and begin to discover who I really am as a student and as an individual."
Have had a lot of fun meeting new people and learning to be on my own.
"I would describe my experience in KU as 'tasty'. From the very welcoming orientation to the rich and engaging lectures, my experience has been made complete by the helpful facilities the university has thoughtfully provided. I love the beautiful campus decorated with flowers and colorful trees in Spring and Fall. We have a writing center that helps with any writing assignment, free buses to get us to classes and some parts of town, an advising center that helps with academic issues, nice cafeterias, friendly teachers and a comprehensive healthcare facility on campus. The student associations host fun activities like volleyball, parties and movies from time to time - campus is never boring."
"The University of Kansas is not only filled with athletically inclined students that represent the school through basketball, football, and other sports but it is filled with friendly, caring, and helpful faculty, staff, and students. The campus is large and has a lot of helpful means of transportation such as the bus and Safe Ride (which are both free to students), but the campus also offers safety to students by using Safe Ride as an option when leaving night classes, and providing emergency phones all around campus. The school is set in a beautiful town that will take your breath away. When you hear the word Kansas you imagine a boring and flat state, but Lawrence is the opposite of that."
I love my school. Would not change it for the world
"I love being at KU, it has opened me up to new experiences and had given me the knowlegde that I can further use in my career path. Being part of the architecture program at KU has given me confidence in my major and has given me the opportunity to learn from amazing professors and also meeting new people and gaining not only friends but family. KU is a WONDERFUL school and I am proud to call myself a Jayhawk!"
"The only factors in a school that I was looking for were the environment and opportunities. I need to feel accepted, safe and like I would enjoy my next few years at the University of Kansas and I definitely believe that it will be a great time and the opportunities will never end."
I love my school and I wouldn't have chosen to go anywhere else
I fell in love with my school since day one. I always knew that was the school I wanted to go to.
The people are really friendly and they wish the best for you
"KU is an amazing school, although it is very expensive."
I recently went on a mission trip to Haiti through my school and that was an amazing experience. I really love how college gives you the opportunity to see the world. I also enjoy my professors and the life long friends I have made while in college.
I love the diversity of the campus. As an international student it makes me feel more welcome
"The classes are difficult but for good reason, other than that it's the best of the best"
"It's a university that comes together through basketball, so sports are a huge deal. Most people are overall friendly and it's not too crazy of an environment."
"It was a great survey. It really made me think about my choice of college. In the end, I would still pick my school. It's the perfect distance, it's the school I want to prove that I can do this on my own."
It's a great school and there are many clubs and opportunities to meet people and get involved. I just wish I had the time to interact in these programs.
"The University of Kansas is built upon many years of tradition, which is one of the best things about coming to this university."
"I would have preferred a college in a larger city. Since I plan on getting business/accounting degree, it would have possibly given more opportunities. The out of state tuition was too high for my budget."
"I am very glad that I chose to attend KU. It is close to home, but I still feel like I can have fun and be responsible on my own. I have made life long friends here and I feel that I have received the education I planned on."
Lots of fan support and team spirit during march.
I dont have much experience with greek life.
This get too crazy in lawrence.
So much at Mass st.
Parking staff is very strict
"Its okay, you have to watch what you eat."
You have to talk to your advisors
I love the many restaurants especially on Mass St.
I am an East coast/Southern girl so I enjoy home cooked meals with a nice glass of sweet tea or water. Some times the areas can be loud and crowded. But everything is hot and ready for you when you come.
The campus is beautiful and the school offers a lot of facilities for the students.
"Lawrence is an AWESOME town. There is a pretty big downtown area (Mass Street) with lots of local restaurants/chain restaurants of every variety. Anything you're in the mood for, you will find and it will more than exceed your expectations. The options are really endless--and there are plenty of options outside of the downtown area as well. If you have the money for off-campus dining, you don't have to go far to find a good place to pick up burgers, pizza, Mexican--whatever you're in the mood for. And the KU website provides a website with the list of restaurants that take Beak 'em Bucks from your meal card too which is a big bonus."
Crime isn't put as a priority but it was last on the list
They are extremely the best !
i don't care for them
They are great and affordable
They are AMAZING especially when you're with your friends
"Financial aid is a hassle but it was not stressful. Tip wise, make sure to do the FASFA and other aids early as possible"
"I was not hyped about living with 3 other females but my room came with a full bathroom and walk in closet. I enjoyed the space and the hospitality. It was a little pricey but the amenities given; bathroom,living and kitchenette, cable and wifi."
"I would do it all over again. As a college freshman, moving to a brand new place where you don't know anybody (especially out of state in my case) can be really scary. But all of my worries about college disappeared after the very first night. The school did an excellent job of providing fun events to get freshmen and new students acquainted with each other and comfortable with being in a new place. Living in the dorms especially was the best experience and brought everyone together."
"Since Kansas City is only 35 minutes away, I'm sure there are endless internship opportunities. As long as you don't get too caught up in the party scene and take your classes seriously, getting a degree from this school should be easy. The career center is always there and there are always people on campus who are more than happy to help you."
"I don't really have any complaints besides the cost. The acceptance rate is 92% for a reason--they want people to attend because they want your money. For that reason, I wouldn't expect a very exceptional academic experience from this school, but probably no better and no worse than any other big university. The school will also charge you for everything, and I wish they would offer students a little bit more for how much it costs."
"Lawrence is really the perfect college town. Probably the best in the country. It's not too big and not too small. Traffic is not bad, there is always something to do, the scenery is beautiful, the downtown is beautiful, there are nice parks, the area is safe. It's only about 35 minutes away from Kansas City. There is also such a strong sense of community in Lawrence, the locals are really friendly and there are people of every age group so it definitely isn't just a college town. I would definitely live here after college."
"KU is such a big school and just like any big university, you'll meet any kind of person you can imagine if you put yourself out there. You're probably most likely to meet somebody if you live in the dorms--this is the best way to meet people and make friends period. Probably the majority of guys/girls are the sporty athletic type, or the stoner type... But it's definitely not limited to that. All kinds of people here, and everyone is really friendly."
"I never felt unsafe on campus. There are emergency telephones all around campus and all the students I met were very friendly, nice people. I think KU really cares about students' safety. I always see the university police around campus"
"I actually don't know much about Greek life besides my experience attending frat parties. A lot of my friends were involved in Greek life, and a lot of my friends were not involved. I don't think it really affects your experience at KU. You definitely don't have to participate in it to be popular, I never felt pressured to be apart of it."
"One word: BASKETBALL. This is obviously what people are excited about at Kansas. Allen Fieldhouse will be completely packed from the first exhibition game, to the last home game of the season. It never ends. And if you aren't a basketball fan before you come to KU, trust me, you probably will be by the time you come here. It's really hard to not be excited about basketball when you are in the birthplace of it."
"I haven't explored the off-campus housing options because I've only lived in the dorms, but just from looking online out of curiosity, the prices look really good. And there are so many cute houses in Lawrence close to campus that would be an excellent choice for a group of friends splitting the rent. I think all of the neighborhoods in Lawrence are all very safe too so I'd never feel worried about safety."
"KU is a party school--we all know this. Frat parties can be fun if you're a girl; most frats will not allow guys to come in, or they will charge guys to get in. If you're a girl you can get into any party for free pretty much. House parties will usually charge guys for cups, and girls get them free. So guys: if you're planning on going to a house party, make sure you bring $5 with you just in case."
"The RA's in the residence halls are really chill. My first RA (who later was replaced by a new RA) was the only ""strict"" person. There was an incident where people were drinking a little in my dorm room, and word got to my RA so she knocked on my door and once I opened it she barged through and started examining my room (which luckily there was no alcohol in sight), but she reported it anyway trying to get everyone in trouble and she ended up getting kicked out of the residence hall for walking into a room without permission lol."
"If you live on Daisy Hill where most residence halls are located, you will be eating most of your meals at Mrs. E's. It can be okay, and SOMETIMES really good, but there is not always much variety. The salad bar always has the exact same stuff and really isn't that good. You can get sandwiches or pizza pretty much every day but it isn't good. And if your class schedule doesn't give you a break during the busy prime lunch hours (11:00--1:00ish) and you have to eat at an awkward time, you will be eating cold food that has been sitting out for 15 minutes."
I don't really know a lot about KU's financial aid process.
"There are a lot of housing options on campus. I lived in McCollum Hall my freshman year, and even though the dorms there were really crappy and small, the social atmosphere made it worth it. Housing is kind of expensive though, especially when you consider how little you get with it. For how much it costs, the school should at least offer free usage of laundry facilities--but nothing at this school is free."
They're there. but not very in your face
"It was okay, KU has trouble with getting it all done, however, the financial aid office is very willing and helpful to try and make it easier on the student."
For the size of Lawrence there is a large variety of restaurants but quantity doesn't always equal quality
"If you're a Greek it's great, everything you would expect. If your not it doesn't really matter."
There are a lot of apartments and old houses for students to rent at all price levels
The downtown scene is great if you're 21+
The campus police don't have a noticeable presence
There aren't many options for out of state or transfer students.
Typical of a state school
"I wish the process was simpler, but I got the aid I needed."
"You get more freedom, but without a car your dining, shopping, and entertainment choices are limited."
Nothing says 'party' quite like watching Netflix alone and eating ice cream.
"There actually is a lot of choices off campus, but keep in mind that some of them are rather far."
They're pretty whatever about what goes on unless it may get out of hand.
"Eating at E's is a crapshoot. Sometimes the food is amazing, and other times it is retch-worthy. It is food however, and it is better than the ramen you might consider eating."
"Housing is okay. Having freshmen throwing up in the bathroom @ 3 am is not the best wake-up call, but it's better than the fire alarm going off @ 5 am. The dorm halls and meeting areas are cleaned weekly, but you probably wouldn't believe that because they always look like a tiny tornado went through them."
The financial aid officer at Edwards campus is terrible. Find someone else to help you.
Takes some patience to get through.
There are so many great people here.
Watkins Health center is a blessing. Make sure to bring a copy of your insurance cards just incase you need it. Sexual assault is not a big issue on campus but I also think it not talked about enough. In my experience alcohol is not usually a factor. Report anything you feel uncomfortable about and KU will be more than happy to help you.
It varies person to person. The only way for you to know is if you go check it out for yourself.
"KU is known for it's basketball program so you know we have our sport facilities decked out. The Ambler Rec Center is really nice and if you are able to get off campus go to Rock Chalk park for even more workout awesomeness. You can life at the Rec but if you want to do olympic/competition style lifting you have to join the lifting club, go to Rock Chalk Park or join a gym. Rock Chalk park is my favorite."
Lawrence has lots of apartments like Legends Place or The Connection that offer lots of amenities. There are also town homes that offer lots of perks as well. If you want to you there are always houses to rent with friends. I recommend living in a house or town homes because of more space and less noise and in my case lower cost. Lawrence isn't very big so commuting to class shouldn't take more than 15 minutes by car and less than 30 minutes by bus if you're at The Connection. The buses are very nice and really the rides to off campus housing by bus is usually less than 20 minutes. You'll have to look for housing on your own because the union holds an open house type thing but really you're on your own but it isn't hard at all and everyone in the community is used to all the students and are very helpful.
Once you make some friends (trust me you will find people) there are parties all over. Also yik yak sometimes helps. LFK.
"Lawrence has the best variety of foods outside of Kansas City. There are vegetarian/vegan options in most places and the pizza or asian or whatever your late night fancy is, its open and its cheap and its delicious. You will quickly figure out your top three pizza places and you will love how fast delivery is for anything you have delivered. If you just want to have some actual food for dinner instead of that dorm diet, your tongue will be overwhelmed by the delicious quality of food. There are restaurants for everyone and the best part is that they always are updating their menus and there are new places opening. You will not get bored of the food in Lawrence."
"It's a college campus so of course there is going to be underage everything happening at some point, they can't catch them all. However, if you are caught your punishment can range from community service and no record to serving time but it depends on what you get caught for. Watch out for KU parking, they will ticket you and especially during basketball games. The campus, and Lawrence itself, is a very safe place and the officers really are there to help you. The SafeBus program they have is a big help, too."
"Keep in mind I lived at Naismith Hall which is a dorm but it's private so not affiliated with KU Housing. It's great because the majority of the food is cooked by actual humans and not just heated up. There are different things to choose from and it is never overcrowded like at Mrs. E's where you have one dining hall for all of Daisy Hill. If you are a vegan you will have an easier time at E's and if you're a vegetarian you will be just fine at Naismith. Living at Naismith is also anywhere from $800 to $1200 cheaper than living on Daisy Hill and I think it is a better value because of the quality of the building, the amenities and the food. If I had to eat anywhere else on campus I would pick the Burge Union, the Union or The Underground. Mrs. E's is a last, last resort for me."
"It really depends on which hall you get into. There is really only one hall that is bad since they are building two more brand new ones. The rooms are actually bigger than the other college dorms I toured before and the community is amazing. It's college so the rules are a bit lax at times but for the majority of the time everyone is respectful of the rules, especially during finals. The best thing for studying in the dorms are the lounges on each floor. You can always find someone in there who can help you if you get stuck on homework or just need a friend. The reason I gave the rating of 'ok' instead of 'great' is because in my hall, but not in all halls, we had community bathrooms. I think that speaks for itself but honestly as a girl it was not terrible and there was only one bathroom nightmare so you'll make it."
There's a lot of houses near campus and some apartment options too but prices and quality aren't great.
"I love going down to Mass. Street and trying something new, there so many different options to choose from."
There's always something to do in Lawrence and there's plenty of options if the bar isn't your scene!
"I had a good RA, but some of my friends had a bad experience with their RA's being too strict"
"My scholarship wasn't great, but that's okay"
"Food isn't the best, but there is always options."
"Dorms at Ku vary, some are pretty old where as others are newly renovated. In the fall of 2015 the university is going to be opening up two new dorms and demolishing one existing dorm, I hear that the new dorms are suppose to be pretty nice. Campus us beautiful, a nice walk to and from class, even though there are some hills. If you live in GSP or Corbin you are right in the center of all college fun- a couple blocks from Massachusetts street, where the best shopping in lawrence happens, a few streets over from all the college bars and hang outs and just up the hill from the football stadium!"
The landlords that we've talked to so far seemed pretty nice and approachable. Housing in the area is reasonable and affordable. The town is dotted with bus stops so it's rare to find an apartment complex without access to one.
There are little shops dotted around the area easilly accessible by bus. I love to just walk around and find new little restaurants for me to try.
The administrators can be busy just because of the sheer number of students who need help. But they get to you when they can.
The Gear Up scholarship has a bit of a delay to it which made me worry a lot during the first few weeks of class.
The food here is not bad. There are days when the food just looks so unappetizing and I just don't want to eat any of it.
The building that me and my boyfriend lived in is scheduled to be torn down after the 2014-2015 school year. Nobody maintained anything and the building was in bad condition. I would have rather just lived in an apartment.
"KU is an awesome, unique school and I would choose it again 100 times!"
"A degree from this school means a lot, and it gives you a great chance of getting a job over a lot of other schools, however this depends on your degree and what type of job it is. Overall it's a great choice for future job prospects!"
"Many off-campus housing options, but the closer they are to campus and the nicer/newer they are, the more expensive they are as well, but it's usually worth it!"
"When it comes to underage drinking and drug use at KU, the campus is strict and enforces the laws."
"Living on campus makes attending KU easier, since everything on campus is within walking distance or on the bus route. There are a variety of brand new dorms to choose from or there are older options, and the social atmosphere is awesome! It's friendly and fun, yet everyone takes their studies very seriously."
"My experience with off-campus housing has been great! My house has a bus stop a block away that takes me to campus when I need to get to class, but it only comes twice an hour and it sometimes late. Our landlord is very nice and helpful in providing us with help with maintenance and repairs on the house when needed. Our house is located on Tennessee Street which is awesome because we are very close to Mass Street where a lot of food and shopping areas are, as well as a lot of bars. Sometimes parking can be a hassle because Tennessee is such a busy street. Overall my off-campus housing experience has been great!"
The off-campus dining near my school is great. There are a very wide variety of options to choose from which is very nice. A lot of great food places are on Mass street and located near shopping stores and other fun places to visit so a trip to Mass street is always a great experience. There are also a couple of great food delivery options that are open late-night.
"The party scene at my school is great. There are a lot of different places where parties happen frequently. If you want to go out during the week, dollar night at the hawk is the place to be. Everything is a dollar and it is always packed. If you want to go out on the weekend, any of the bars are usually crowded and fun, there are also a lot of fraternity parties on the weekends, though that is not my favorite scene. House parties are also very fun if you know some of the people there."
"The financial aid process went pretty smoothly at KU for me. The staff at the financial aid office is very helpful and available to answer any questions you may have. I had some problems filing for financial aid this past year due to a fire in my home that destroyed important documents that I needed to file financial aid, but the financial aid office was very understanding and helpful through that process."
"The food options on campus such as the underground and the pulse are great. They have a pretty wide variety of food options available and usually have enough staff working to handle the amount of people that come in to get food. The coffee at the pulse is amazing! I think it's even better than Starbucks! However, the food in the dorms (especially Oliver) is awful. Not many options or choices for food are available daily and it is often hard to find healthy options."
Living on campus was my best experience in college. The friends I made in my dorm freshman year are still some of my best friends. I loved the social atmosphere of the dorms. There were always people to talk to and people to hangout with. Sometimes the dorms were not the best place to be when I needed to focus on studying because people got loud and distracting. The bathrooms and showers were not spotless but they weren't very dirty and were cleaned often. The internet connection was not great but it worked enough to get homework done. My dorm was close to campus so on nice days I could walk to class. Busses came by the dorms fairly often as well to take students to campus. Overall my dorm experience was a great one!
KU could have a better sexual assault policy.
Greek life at KU is okay.
KU is a very athletic school.
The off-campus housing is okay.
Off -campus dining is normal for any city.
"The financial aid at KU is okay, but it is not the best."
"The campus housing and the dorms are okay at the University of Kansas, however the cost of housing is so quite expensive for the quality"
There are a ton of options for students including low rates and animal friendly apartments.
"I hardly ever eat off campus but from what I hear, it is pretty decent food."
There are really very few rules that must be followed on campus.
The loans are set up oddly and are hard to handle. I also dislike that the loans mainly go through my parents.
It is fairly decent food and there are a lot of options.
"Overall, it is exactly what I would expect from a college dorm."
I think that it is amazing. Some unhealthy but still very good
It depends on where on campus you live. Some places are rough but the new dorms will fit in perfect.
There are many different off campus housing options and the availability is pretty high too. Almost all options are pretty close to campus or campus transportation. Some areas of Lawrence are safer than others.
There are tons of off campus dining options that very from type of food and cost. Dining in Lawrence is always a new experience.
Campus is not very strict about a lot of things except drug and alcohol use in the dorms. They take that pretty seriously.
The bar scene on campus is great. There is always something going on and a ton of great promotions.
"Although tuition is expensive for out of state students, I received the financial aid I needed and the process was very easy."
"Some days are better than others. I enjoy the salad bar at Mrs. E's, however I wish there were more poultry and fish options and more low calorie options."
The dorm I live in is not located very close to my classes. The cost is somewhat expensive for the quality of living. There is constant noise because of neighbors next to and above me. My dorm is in close proximity to the cafeteria so that is beneficial. The people that work at the front desk are always nice and very helpful.
"You do what you have to do. I live in the dorm (thus cooking is ""prohibited""). So I must eat on campus sometime. Breakfast is the best meal (hare to screw up scrambled eggs). Lunch options abound on campus to include Chick-Fil-A. Dinner can be a crap shoot. But, if there is nothing good in Mrs. E's, there is always pizza."
"The dorms are ok. We have dumb rules around when heat and A/C can be turned on so it seems one is always hot or cold. I do like my room- I have a single. No roommate fights. If I want company I can always hang out with someone. The room is fairly Spartan, but since I am out about anyway (usually in a practice room), it's ok. The food is ok. If you do not like cafeteria food, there are plenty of other options on and off campus."
It is good most places are chains or are kind of $
The school has a great balance
There is an automatic academic scholarship
The options are endless but most of the dining halls have extremely processed food and most of it is not healthy.
"KU is an open, friendly, and accepting social and campus. I would not want to live anywhere else. The different dorms are like their own little communities yet they are not exclusive."
"So many awesome houses surround campus and nice apartments. A lot of unique places because the campus is surrounded by all these old Victorian homes that are taken over by drunk college students. Prices are usually reasonable depending on how much you look, more expensive the closer you get to campus and the less roommates you have"
"Huge variety of places to choose from, all conveniently on Mass and throughout Lawrence. A lot of places deliver and offer student discounts. A lot of trademark Lawrence places and local dining."
"Average strictness, cheating is usually hard to get away with depending on the teacher, alcohol is easy to get away with as long as you are discreet about it in the dorms. Mostly the students are responsible enough to the point where not a huge amount of security is needed"
"KU is a party school. Some people can't handle it. But for those that can, there is something happening every night of the week. Especially during basketball season. It's crazy but so much fun."
KU hardly gives financial aid. I applied and was only offered loans. My roommate that received a grant is having a hard time communicating with the school about attending a community school and transferring back to KU and is being told she has to start paying her loans now. Most people don't even apply if they don't live in a very low income household.
"Dining hall options are okay - but definitely gets old.

Food on campus - there is a huge selection and its all pretty good, crunchy chicken cheddar wraps are the most popular."
"Dorms - most all freshmen live in dorms, and eventually move out as sophomores. Rules are generally enforced but easy to get around if you are discreet about drinking. The more expensive dorms are really nice and the cheaper ones are much less. There's a pretty big gap between the two. Dining plans are okay, food is okay but gets old after awhile. Socially, dorms are a great way to meet people and most people meet their group of friends through the dorms."
"There are a ton of choices, it just depends on whether or not you are willing to waste money."
Administration affects everyone's experience differently.
"It's impossible to have a bad time. If you're going out looking for fun, you'll find it."
"There's always something to eat, it just isn't always easy to eat healthy."
"I love living on campus, although my dorm is ""private."" The students are great and KU really does make you feel at home."
"The professors are great. They really do wish that their students succeed, Popular study areas are in the library and on grassy areas on campus"
"Students have a very good chance of getting a job on campus, the workload isn't very difficult to handle"
Their is a variety but I don't eat off campus very often
They do their job very well
The dorms are really clean and friendly
Mrs E's can have their off days where there is nothing good to eat
"I got money, it was decent."
Probably one of the highlights of going to KU.
"I live in Oliver, not vegetarian friendly, not a lot of options, not open early enough on weekends. I do like the cuisine to go though!"
"My room has no air conditioning, maintenance has come by 4 times and still not fixed it, it was so hot in my room one week I had to sleep elsewhere. I live on the 3rd floor near the loading dock for the kitchens and the sounds are so loud I get woken up at 7 every morning."
Many options to live off campus and all quality options.
Plenty of great and quality options to eat off campus
The University of Kansas does have strict policies but are necessary to ensure the safety of our school.
The University of Kansas was able to offer me a fantastic scholarship.
Night life at the University of Kansas is always exciting
"At the University of Kansas, the dining hall food isn't the greatest quality but the unlimited meal plan and large amount of choices make it worth it."
At the University of Kansas the residence halls are one of the greatest places to live. The residents are treated fairly and the amenities make the cost well worth it.
"my apartment is ok, roommate sucks"
ok choices same as anywhere
not really dealing with them
dont party much i work
There are tons of great deals and choices for students when it come to of campus housing. A lot of these place come fully furnished as well which is helpful.
I usually do not go out to eat but I have been recommended to go to multiple place so I assume that the food is very good.
I feel like KU is just as struck as the next.
"This year I had benefits from the GI bill, but the process was kind of annoying."
"When it comes to parties KU is one of the best schools to attends there is constantly something to do throughout the week, especially during basketball season and the spring when we are winning !!"
Food is pretty decent it could be a lot better. Sometimes thing taste well but on others I don't want to eat at all.
"It easy extremely fun living here. Yes, things aren't the best and the newest but the people and community make up for all the bad things. Everyone is polite and very helpful when someone is in need. Cost is a little much for what we are actually living in."
"been a great experience, good sense of school spirit"
"Not interested in greek life, seem very stereotypical"
Not really interested in off campus living. Most places look old and run down.
Haven't really dined off campus much.
"There are some things that are more strict than others, not very even"
"confusing process, hard to get any money from the school"
"I don't go partying, but I hear it's great."
There are a lot of choices on and off campus. For me I always have a meal at my scholarship hall so I never have to worry about food.
"I used to live in a dorm, but now I live in a scholarship hall. The difference between the two is huge. I would never go back to dorm life after living in a scholarship hall. There is a stronger sense of community, the facilities are nicer and cleaner. And I live right on the main campus."
I enjoy my program so far
Not a bad selection for small town
okay for small college town
Not many options for graduate students
This is KU. The school revolves around Basketball season.
I love the dining scene off-campus. There are plenty of places to try just on Mass Street alone.
"I think that the strictness at KU is in the perfect amount. They are rather strict on things like drinking and drug use in dorms, but things like protests and social movements they are very lenient and accepting about."
"The dorm food isn't the best. It's usually very processed, and very limited in selection. There are VERY little vegetarian options, and I usually end up having to eat only salad and soup for 2 meals a day, which gets very old very fast. The underground and the Union are probably the best places for on campus food, and the Pulse/The Roasterie are the best (and really only) options for things like smoothies and coffee on campus."
"I have enjoyed living on campus for the most part. There is a lot of drinking that happens off campus by the students who live in the same floor as me, so there is often disruptions during the middle of the night. The campus atmosphere is absolutely centered around Jayhawk Basketball, and with good cause. The cost for in state is reasonable, and I think you get for what you pay for. The food in the dorms is not always the best, but it is worth paying for. The housing process itself is rather simple and stress-free, at least in my experience."
"Off-campus housing is a good option. There are tons of different houses and apartment complexes to choose from, and the cost is definitely cheaper than on-campus living. However, everywhere is pretty far away from campus, so be prepared to drive."
"There are tons of restaurants and places to eat around town. If you want it, we've got it."
"Buses run constantly, however, they are almost always full at certain times."
"Parking sucks on campus. If you live in the dorm, good luck ever finding parking. Also, all the lots are really far away from classes, so plan on walking a lot."
"Technology is great! They have tons of computers and places to print, and the WiFi is pretty good throughout campus."
"Dining hall food is not great, although there are plenty of choices. The food at the unions, though, is really good. Crunchy chicken cheddar all the way!"
"Depending on the dorm, most campus housing is good. They are also building two brand new dorms this year, so those should be nice."
"I do not receive any aid. I am all on student loans but in terms of aid that I do not have to pay back, I do not get help. I did not get enough loan money to cover my tuition, which in turn forced me to give up some classes I wanted to take or was hoping to, as well as some activities I wanted to do."
"I love being closer to home to see my family while still enjoying my college experience. Having my close friends here and being able to join various clubs makes things much better. Professors of the Business School here are definitely helpful as well, they have made my semester a great one, and it has just begun."
"Our Basketball team is one of the top teams in the nation. It is an amazing atmosphere at Allen Field House. I love watching our Baseball Boys as well, and Football gives a nice tailgating environment. Rock Chalk Jayhawk!"
"We have the underground, which gives a small amount of choices such as Chick-Fil-A, salad bars, etc. Not a big variety and of course prices will be much more but it's enough to get you by whenever you need."
I have never had problems or a disgust around campus. Everything is well kept and satisfying!
"I never had to come across experiencing problems, so I am not sure how to answer this personally but based off of reading policies, KU is strict where it needs to be."
"Now that I am primarily doing course work pertaining to my intended major, the Professors are great and relatable and topics have become much more interesting."
"Can be a little sloppy at times, but friends make it fun even though things can get crowded."
"Dining here has a lot of variety from common places you would find in the Kansas City Area, to, local smaller restaurants. There are also your basic fast food places when you're on the go."
The variety of off-campus dining is amazing. You can order pizza up to like 4am from various places and they do give student discounts or special offers. there's really something for everyone.
I've gotten good academic scholarships and grants. The office is VERY helpful.
Students are very diverse. You will find a niche. Everyone is friendly regardless of how they fall socially. I've taken my 2 year old to undergrad events and literally everyone is kind and plays with him.
"I live in an apartment with my husband and child, it's very nice. The apartment living office is helpful and mantainence is prompt. The dorms are also very spacious, the atmosphere is nice & people are friendly."
"I don't think they are too strict or too lenient. there are times when things could be handled better, but you can't please everyone."
"I LOVE my major and program. I'm a human biology major, mostly taking the general science requirements. The workload is enough that I feel challenged but also have a social life. The curriculum is engaging and the professors are helpful and knowledgeable. The undergraduate labs are interesting. Research is fairly easy to get involved with thanks to the Undergraduate Research Center."
"I think the off-campus housing selection is good. Some bad apples exist, but you find that everywhere. Most property holders are kind and helpful."
"If you're into athletics, KU's basketball teams are very supported by the student body. Going to the games is a big deal and camping is pretty fun. The facilities in the student gyms are great and the Robinson pool is nice."
"The Underground is pretty expensive, but the smoothies and coffee from the Pulse are delicious and well worth it. E's usually has a good variety."
"There are crime & safety issues, but they are always handled very quickly by public safety & KU police. Alerts are sent to students and everyone is aware."
This college and town would not be nearly as enjoyable without sports.
It's a great town but somewhat small and far away from any big cities.
Parties are good for most students it gives them a chance to have a break from school and work.
The availability of parking is the worst and is very inconvenient.
The alumni from here are all very proud to have come here and support current students.
Class sizes are small if you are in the honors program.
There are chain restaurants and local restaurants which is nice for out of state students.
SAfebus is always around but the lighting could be improved significantly.
I like to order out
I don't go out much
I think that the fan support is a big part of campus
There are cameras all over campus but there have been crime scares in the past
I had no problems at all
There are a little shopping places and have been some safety scares in the past
I don't participate much in parties. I did attend a fraternity party that was fun. I think the impact is very positive.
Basketball is great. Football leaves a lot to be desired.
I feel safe enough on campus. Had one incident with my car where someone did a hit and run and campus police were not very helpful. Parking is terrible at the dorm and no effort to help out even though I paid a lot of money.
Mass St is awesome. Nice area to be in.
"The hall I live in is the worst possible. It should be condemned - no hot water, bathing facilities do not work, water is non functioning - should be condemned by health department. Not welcoming at all."
I have looked on my own and been impressed with availability
I have encountered no problems.
It is difficult to get into a greek group that you really want. It appeared that preselections were already made prior to rush week.
"I love my majors, the faculty and staff are caring and helpful!"
"Better than the dining hall, but also costs more money."
Lawrence has its own charm as a small town
"Not a big party person, but from my friends' reviews, it can be rowdy but guarantee a good time"
Not a big fan of Greek Life but they are very organized and can be very helpful to one's college career
"I love the academic culture in KU, it is competitive but everyone is very helpful!"
"Do it early or you will get headaches, especially international students"
Sports are a big part in KU's tradition and it will continue to be so.
"It is pretty good, but it can be a little bit pricey"
There are fairs for your major at the beginning of the year giving you an opportunity to gain knowledge on future companies you would be interested in. I am always getting emails about possible internships in my major which is a nice option to have.
"The administration has had a positive impact since my coming to Lawrence, but very little at that. The administration has had very little impact on me."
athletics at school are a big deal & everyone gets involved & has a great time
everyone is nice & helpful with everything
to apply as soon as possible
cost around the same as a dorm maybe a little more but you have more included
They are pretty lenient on some things but they try to be respectful to others therefore if they have to write you up they will
There is usually always something to do & someone to do anything with
Nothing bad really happens in Lawrence but if it does it is taken seriously
Nothing bad really happens & everyone is always in a good mood & fun to be around
Off-campus dining near the University of Kansas is busy but they always try their best to be polite & help you as soon as possible
There's no shortage of bars in Lawrence.
"Lawrence, Kansas is a lovely college town. Very happy I spent 5 years there."
I never lived on campus and loved my experience.
Lawrence has a nice variety of food options.
The scholarships process was very simple and easy.
The school does what it has to do.
Lawrence has a great local scene.
there is always a party happening
"love KU basketball, wish clubs and intramurals were a bigger deal"
starting to become a problem
"wouldnt have it any other way, couldnt imagine college without being part of greek life"
didin't expect anything more or less
a little bit of everything you coule ever need
"Could always use more money, kind of a confusing set up to figure out"
there's a little bit of everything
still a party school but they keep it reasonable
All expensive and most are old for broke college kids
Getting into the School of Engineering simply took the filling out of an application as soon as I was accepted to KU
The only disappointing aspect of Greek life on campus is the lack of recognition for the African American Greek organizations. They don't have special housing or any of the benefits that the mostly Caucasian organizations obviously enjoy. I'd like to see more equal treatment.
"There's plenty of variety when it comes to off-campus food options. The prices are reasonable although there could be more places with student discounts. However, unless you have a car, most of these places are not easily accessible."
"Policies on attendance varies by professor. Some professors take off points for absences while others let you do your own thing. As long as you don't miss much class, you should be fine."
"The school barely gave me any financial aid. Although my family is far from poor, I would still consider us middle class and my parents did not have much money saved up for my college education. The money the we did have saved was quickly used up for my many college expenses so we were really hoping that the school could at least partially make up for that. Unfortunately, I was only awarded $1000. Although I was grateful for it, it didn't account for much."
"KU Athletics overshadows every aspect on campus, or at least it seems that way. The athletes obviously get special privileges which I wouldn't have a problem with since they worked hard for the position. However, every other student is there for the academics whereas most athletes are there for their sport which is a little unfair since the majority of us are actually attending school to obtain a degree unlike the athletes who are mostly trying to go to the professional league of their appropriate sport."
"There is only one off-campus building available to students provided by the University. Every other off-campus living arrangement is not university-related. Some are relatively close, and others, not so much. However, a lot of the popular apartment complexes are on the campus bus route which is nice. Some of the prices for these apartments are fairly reasonable, however, considering that mainly college students live there, the pricing could be better."
"The University of Kansas has a high level of security withing the dorm and apartment buildings. However, outside there is not much security. There are various emergency phone stations to use in case of any state of disaster such as sexual assault, but they are spread pretty far apart from each other. Besides that, I don't believe there are any other security features that are easily accessible to a person outside a building."
Loved it. Happy to be a Jayhawk
It was a very difficult program. The teachers push you but are very concerned for your well being. They frequently check in on me post graduation to see how I am doing.
I loved my major. The application process was not difficult.
As a vegetarian with extensive food allergies I rarely ate on campus. If I wanted carrot sticks I'd just buy them and stay in my room.
"They have something for everyone. Classy places to just relax and drink a martini, and many that are throwing people out for having a few extra drinks and starting trouble."
"The parking department is horrible. I've watched the people who enforce stand and watch the time count down, then give tickets to meters as the person is walking up to pay."
The rush process for sororities is very much based on your major/family money. Many of the girls I rushed with that had wonderful personalities were rejected based on not being physically perfect.
"RA's were a bit out of control. Would allow drinking/drug, would punish for an electric tea kettle....I was forced to write a letter of apology to the dorm due to my tea kettle that had no exposed coils and an automatic shut off."
"Meadowbrook apartments were fantastic. I lived there most of the time I was in college. They are close to campus, the buildings are very safe, the cost is more than reasonable considering the close campus proximity, they are very clean, I can't say enough fantastic things"
I always felt safe on campus. Some of my classes were late and I would have to park a short distance from my vehicle. Students were always happy to walk me to my vehicle.
"As a vegetarian with a long list of food allergies, there are lots of fantastic places for me to eat in Lawrence. There are many local businesses want to please the diners and go out of their way to be accommodating."
Lawrence is an AMAZING city. I can't say enough wonderful things about the culture and diversity there.
Scholarships were fantastic. As a female in engineering I was delighted to see that there were many dedicated to females pursuing math/engineering/science majors.
"There is a major basketball culture at the university. I have since moved away from Kansas and frequently have people notice Jayhawk apparel and shout out ""rock chalk!"""
"The food in the courts on campus is okay. The new Indian place is pretty good and there is Chic Fila and Panda Express if you are looking for something decent to eat in a hurry. Each of the food courts have some organic and healthy options for those that care about what they eat, but beverages are limited. They must have sold out to Coca Cola because that is all there is to drink. Luckily, a lot of buildings on campus now have water fountains with bottle dispensers and you can take your own drink into the student unions."
"its close to the classes and the rec,"
"greek life is great albeit, can be cliquey"
its safe but there are always crazy people
"the atmosphere is great, always ready to play sports"
Great dining options on not terribly high cost
Prices and location varies but a wide variety of places.
KU basketball is the reason why Kansas is the best.
Lawrence is the best towns to enjoy college.
Lots of options and very affordable.
Greek life looks enjoyable and supportive of their members.
The University helps to provide the safest environment possible.
Lots of social people who are not afraid to make new friends.
Campus strictness is positively enforced throughout the dorms and campus. The officers understand that college is the most exciting time for students and they help the students make good decisions. Some concern is the issue over the rape allegations.
"I love living off campus, there are many places to choose to live that are incredibly close to campus and have a rent that is reasonable. However, besides handing out flyers, there doesn't seem to be much help from KU to help students find housing after living in the dorms."
"Great food places in lawrence, but there should be more student discounts available"
I think teachers should be more strict on attendance so more students will show up to class.
"There seems to be a sense of superiority from the Greek side vs. the non-greeks, but not enough to where it's a problem."
"There is a ton of school spirit, especially during basketball season."
Campus crime has been increasing lately and it seems to not be as big of a deal as it should be because of the lack of notice/ lateness of notice being given to the students.
I wish I had more scholarships for my awesome grades.
"I've heard it's pretty great, don't have experience myself though."
"We have the best choice of restaurants, I promise. You have to try Fuzzy's Taco Shop and Pizza Shuttle!"
"Don't have a whole lot of experience with it, but it's trying it's hardest."
A lot of bad reputations.
"dont know much about it, new student"
Best basketball team around the area. Basketball games in the student section are unforgettable and give you chills.
"I like it here at Park 25 a lot. You can find an apartment that fits your needs and wants easily, there are tons of choices. I love this college town, it's amazing."
"It's great if you are into basketball, but the football program is a total embarrassment."
"It's Kansas, need I say more?"
Amazing selection for the middle of no-where. There are some great options.
"They are just punching the time clock, they don't really want you to report crimes because they may have to actually investigate. They have a handshake agreement with the local police."
"They are building some new ones, that should help. What is there now is dated and run down."
KU is surrounded by a college ghetto of old homes that have been converted into multi-unit habi-trails of bad smells and mold. Apartment complexes are located a little further out and are your typical thin-walled cheap affairs designed for minimum building cost and maximum profit. Only a handful of individuals control the lion's share of properties so you are going pay premium money for a marginal place.
"It's awesome if you are into just hanging out and pounding beers, that kind of action can be found almost every night through out the college ghetto. They have pretty good bands in the joints on Mass, but they are expensive and most definitely mid-western hobunky. If you are into something more sophisticated and worldly, Lawrence just doesn't cut it but if you like pick up trucks, hipster beers and plaid shirts, this is the town for you."
The basketball games have a great atmosphere and basketball especially gets a lot of public attention and is the center of almost everything!
"I feel safe but not too safe, I know that there are cameras almost everywhere but it doesn't mean it still can't and won't happen without with being seen."
Off campus housing is convenient when you live close to campus but if you not there are buses that will take to you class but they aren't always reliable. I think its a lot harder to make friends with people if you live off campus but there are other ways around that.
Off campus there are a variety of different options to choose from but not all of the dining options are convenient driving wise. The best place right now to try out would have to be Burgerfi which just open in Lawrence on Massachusetts Street a few weeks ago!
"The University of Kansas is not very strict, since its a very liberal school but it does have standards and rules students must abide by."
Fun and supportive college town.
Lots of variety. Nice facility
I feel safe. There are people I can call if I need to walk at night on campus.
Not too bad at all!
Love the multidisciplinary research building for NMR analysis.
Great atmosphere and the friendliness of the city is next to none!
sports are huge here! even football which we do not excel at everyone still comes out in support. We have the best fan base!
Getting Scholarships here seems impossible and for those people like me who really need them makes attending an expensive school very stressful.
Tonic is the best club around Lawrence. There is always a great mix of great people ready to just let loose. No fights and little to no danger.
There are always shows and places to go on the weekend to distract you from studying. Atmosphere aside from school is great!
Depending on where you live and who your landlord is there can be huge variations in cleanliness and work that needs to be done. Best options would be the refurnished apartments off campus.
There are tons of places to choose from! Great food and a variety of cuisines.
There are loads of opportunities for off campus living. Some may be farther away than others but there is a great bus system that runs throughout Lawrence that allows students to get from class and back home in a timely fashion.
I love my major and the classes surrounding it that I have taken I greatly enjoy. However there are many mandatory classes that have nothing to do with the career path I hope to pursue and those classes are very challenging for me. My GPA has suffered because I cannot achieve good grades in those classes but they are mandatory for me to take in order to graduate.
I have a lot of friends in the greek life here on campus and they always have nothing but great things to say about the greek system. It just was not for me. I still get invited to events in the greek atmosphere and I don't feel treated much different because I am not in a greek house.
Our university views safety and school policies as a top priority. From cheating in classes to sexual assaults in our guide lines there are clear identifications that these actions will not be tolerated from neither a school nor legal standard. Our university seeks to keep this atmosphere as safe and secure as possible for all its faculty and students in attendance.
"I personally feel like living off campus is a bad idea. It's harder to make friends, and be in activities. It may be cheaper if enough research is done, but the cons outweigh the pros in my opinion."
"I have never had the opportunity to experience an internship, but I have shadowed a chiropractor and a physical therapist. The experience helped greatly in my career planning and livelihood decision."
"There are may attractions and fun things to do off campus, but the safety issue needs to be addressed, especially where the campus policy on rape is concerned. A rapist was let off with some community service and an essay here, and the victim was harassed and blamed. This doesn't inspire confidence in my own safety here."
"We at KU host the worlds best Quidditch team. We are Ferocious!

Additionally the rec center is excellent, and always clean. The cycling team is not well followed but very good. I don't think I could neglect to mention basketball. The basketball team is very popular."
"As a vegetarian, I was very pleased to see all of the options given in this community. Even in the residence halls there were vegetarian and even vegan options for almost every meat option. There are coffee shops that are open all night on campus that also sell food, and off campus dining is generally affordable and close."
"The campus is strict about substance abuse and alcohol consumption, but they realize that things like underage drinking and partying will happen, so students are given resources to protect themselves as well."
Though I am not a member of a Greek community I find that the volunteer work and projects undertaken in the Greek fraternities and sororities to be both inclusive and helpful to other volunteer organizations and the community.
"Most of the time, I can find something that I could have but there are not many options since I am vegetarian. Thankfully the rates are affordable so eating out once in while is not bad."
There is a health clinic that is accessible for all students that is located next to the rec center.
LFK. Lawrence F****** Kansas. One of the best college towns ever. A prime example of a great college town.
"Most dorms are nice such as Lewis, Hashinger, GSP, and Naismith. However dorms like McCollum and Oliver are old and run down. Luckily, McCollum is being razed next year and future freshmen won't have to experience it."
Administration is always there to help make your lives easier.
There is always something to do in LFK. The Hawk and Cave are VERY lenient with fake ID's and there are always decent parties happening on the weekends. The only tough part is walking to these parties.
"KU Basketball isn't a sport here. It's a religion. Our football team is going through some tough times right now and that is a big reason for the low fan turnout, but come basketball season, everyone is at Allen Fieldhouse."
So many different food options in Lawrence
There's ALWAYS something going on
Dorms are not only big but kept very clean and safe
There is no better place to watch basketball than Allen Fieldhouse.
Going greek was the best decision I have ever made. My sisters are absolutely amazing and have helped me transition to a big school in a different state
"The university truly treats its students like adults and gives us full responsibility for our actions. Services, such as SafeBus and SafeRide, are there if we need them, but for the most part campus strictness is very lenient and fair."
There are some nice dorms but some are pretty old.
It was very difficult for me to pick a major and they don't really explain them to you.
The political science department offers lots of opportunities to help you find a job and get experience.
They are very strict when it comes to plagiarism and research
Campus is usually a very safe place and there are rarely any problems
parties on weekends are the best especially house parties
it helps you gain experience and skills for future work
campus safety cops are always on the look out for any suspicious activities
I dont know much about greek life
"Great living off campus, apartments prices are reasonable to afford"
Possession of fire arms is strongly prohibited
Great athletic program and fans are the best in the world
very exciting and students like to party a lot
Seems great for those that do that.
Like any scholarship opportunities there are requirements to meet and hoops to jump through.
"I don't take part, but I know there are a lot of options for partying."
There's a lot of diversity. It's great.
At the University of Kansas getting my financial aid was easy. It was all link online and it told me what forms I needed to fill out. It have me an estimate of how much I needed and where to go if I needed more.
At the University of Kansas they send you an email with a housing guide if you do not choose to live on campus. This guide tells you the do's and dont's of choosing a place. It also gives links to apartments and other off campus living places.
"Administration is very strict on some issues, like parking and plagiarism, but not so strict on others, like alcohol."
"Most of the buildings are pretty old and the dorms are far from classes, but the overall quality of buildings and dorms isn't bad."
The best parties are house parties
"Instead of telling my to come back in a couple months, give me types of scholarships I could earn."
"The university does nothing to prevent sexual assaults. The university tries to hide sexual assaults and degrades women by giving out statements such as ""Women who take birth control give consent to all sexual behaviors."" As a young woman myself I feel unsafe on campus and not proud to be apart of this university."
"Have you ever heard of Kansas men's basketball? It is the biggest sport on campus, but other sporting events are also attended and supported by students. Some of the less popular sports give out free things and sports other than football and men's basketball are free for students."
Greek life as a whole is viewed as cliquey but most students will get to know someone and not base their judgement of a person on their involvement in Greek life.
There are a variety of both local and chain restaurants in Lawrence.
"This school is very old and isn't quite appealing to the eye. I haven't noticed a lot of places for students to sit outside and study on nice days. Also, the campus is on a hill, and it is A LOT of walking."
"In my program, the class sizes are smaller than for a typical class on campus. The professors are alright. Some are better than others."
There are many job opportunities with the degree that I will be getting from this school. KU is a well-known institution.
I really haven't paid attention to the strictness on campus. I would guess it's alright.
"It was a lot of hard work to get into my program. I feel though that even if I didn't have perfect grades/volunteer work, etc, I still could have gotten in."
"I do enjoy my program, I've met most of my best friends there."
there are a lot of parties to go to. they dont get out of control as much and its nice to meet and see new people
There is variety but for me i love mexican food and there are not a lot of places.
i struggled with receiving my financial aid and for it to go cover my expenses
There are tons of things to do on campus as well as off campus and its not very far to get to them
Living on campus is great. there are a lot of nice people to socialize with.
the campus is not as close to get to your classes
i have not had an internship but i would like to have one for the experience.
its great because you are surrounded by people who have similar goals as you.
you have to check in at 11pm with your card if not you are not allowed to go your dorm
Not easy to find but near KC so it's convenient.
"No problem at all, very helpful advisors."
"I was a volleyball player last year, and even as a female team we were recognized and treated just like men's basketball... which is huge."
I really like my dorm (Oliver) but girls party too hard
"I wish they would do more about the weed in the dorms, but nothing invasive or annoying by the cops. They make rounds every weekend at least."
"Well, obviously our B-Ball team is one of the best, but I don't do sports."
"I don't know much about it, but it's really easy to get it at KU. Not at all like the movies where the bitches only want other hot bitches, but it's a lot of money and you have to dedicate a certain number of hours to Greek events."
I love taking a walk down to Mass St where all the foods and cool shops are. Lawrence holds concerts and 5k runs often and the KU Rec center is pretty nice.
"I was given 4 scholarships my freshman year, but each year the office seems to lose half of our FAFSA and verification paperwork which is confusing considering it's all sent electronically."
Pizza shuttle is open all night and taco bell is
"There are tons of apartments and neighborhoods with rentable houses around here. It's nothing fancy, of course, but it can be great for a couple of friends getting together and splitting the cost."
"Don't worry, don't stress. There's just endless amount of booze; you probably won't get caught."
"My favorite classes were not my major classes. Art History and English classes were by far the most interesting/compelling courses for me. Great professors, great options."
"The reason I go to school here is because of the alumni. As for job/internship prospects, that clearly depends on an individual's major and personal drive to succeed."
"From what my friends have told me, start the process immediately."
"Some departments are superb, others are just average. However, it has great resources for those interested in studying abroad, studying languages, and interested in hard sciences. However, their art and design program are not competitive programs in the long run. I'd say take classes there, but take advantage of going abroad to very good art schools at the price of KU enrollment."
"I'm an illustration major. For one, the freshman courses were a joke. A lot of projects that have little to nothing to help improve our illustration skills. I did improve my graphic design skills, and now I can use a xacto knife to a piece of foamcore in a way that puts any novice to shame. However, I wanted to learn to draw, paint, etc., but my course load, even at 18 hours each semester, did not let me do that. The facilities for the design and art program students are great, but the faculty is currently limited to only thee professors, and they only have two professors that work full time. They put much more allure to the program based on the potential of what the program ""could be"" and not what it currently is. I was disappointed, which made me either consider switching to the graphics program or transferring to better school with a less bullshit program. I wasn't challenged in the way that I wished to be challenged, nor do I feel I gain skills in drawing or painting."
"It's a really lovely college town. There are great places to eat, the living is good, but it can be a bit small. There comes a point when you become a local to the various places; not much to really experience newly."
"I've been able to receive some scholarships, but as for financial aid in the form of loans, they weren't worth it to me to accept. :("
The campus is overall a very nice campus. The buildings all aesthetically match while still being different enough that one can easily tell them apart. There are two main places to eat on the main campus and both have a plethora of choices. There are also small food/drink stops all over campus; every library and building has one so you can always find something to eat. The libraries have great study areas and there are lots of computers to use. Printing is easy and each student gets some print money from there tuition each semester and you can always add more. Everyone on campus is friendly and will try to help out if you need it.
"I think the diversity on campus is pretty great. There are many different types of students that you could interact with. And really, everyone is pretty accepting. You don't really hear or see any problems people have with fitting in or finding any friends. Even if someone is different, more than likely there's going to be someone who's just as different as them, and they would then connect and become friends."
"Our school has one of the top men's basketball programs in the nation. So of course basketball is really big. Almost every game is sold out and students even have to camp out just to get into the games. At other sport events, the fan support is definitely still there. I would say my school has great school spirit. You always see lots of students getting involved."
"When it comes to campus, I feel pretty safe at most times. There usually isn't a lot of violence that goes on during the school year on campus. I always make sure to not walk alone at night and to pay attention to my surroundings. There are security cameras on campus and there are also telephones that notify the police when the button is pressed all along the campus. I believe those are pretty helpful for students."
I absolutely love where I go to school. It's a great place for students and residents as well. The people are friendly and there are a lot of events to attend.
Campus dining is great. There are a lot of options.
I honestly don't pay much attention to those who aren't friends.
I think KU has a great reputation because of the knowledge that is imparted with every student when they leave here.
We have a lot of GTA's who are often a few years older than us. The math program at KU however is structured very poorly.
Campus strictness is average overall.
Lawrence has a great transportation system.
"As with any school, KU's financial aid department often poses its own hurdles in receiving funding in an easy manner."
There is currently no greek housing for any of the Divine Nine chapters. I've never been involved in Greek life and don't know too much more about it on campus
I no longer party but when I did it was often hit and miss. Most of the clubs are the same and they could use a lot of improvement.
"There is a lot of variety off campus. However, the pricing is usually a bit steep."
KU is known to have the some of the best fans/prideful students around and it shows in campus life. There's almost always something going on on campus.
"I love the Rec center! They have everything: fitness equipment, tracks, numerous courts, racquetball, rock climbing, everything! There's so much to do and the equipment is modern and easy to use."
"Although is a predominantly white campus, there is so much diversity. I just love it!"
"They provide a lot of options. I've seen a lot of different places like Asian cuisine, Indian, Vegan, Chinese, etc. There's definitely a lot of great pizza places with convenient prices; my favorites are Pyramid Pizza and Pizza Shuttle. There's also great places for treats like ice cream, coffee shops, Billy Vanilly cupcakes, and Hot Box cookies! (Must haves)"
"KU is a dry campus, so all dorm and scholarship halls are very strict when it comes to alcohol and drugs. Other than that, strictness on other matters depend on which halls you stay in. Most of them aren't strict on other matters besides, noise violations and controlled guest policies."
"There's plenty of places to eat at KU. The main dining hall is Mrs. E's, located on Daisy Hill. I personally stayed in a scholarship hall with a unique meal plan so people within the hall cooked. Popular dining options are: Mr.s E's (Daisy Hill), the Underground (Wescoe Beach), and the Market (Kansas Union). There's a variety of options including Pizza Hut, Panda Express and Chic Fil A. There's also plenty of places outside of the campus that accepts Beak Em Bucks."
"There's practically something to do every night. The most popular places to go to are: The Hawk, the Jackpot, the Grenada, Ice House, and Wilde's Chateau. KU is a party campus. There's always clubs, bars, or fraternity parties to go to. The'yr all pretty much a convenient distance from the campus. If you don't have a car then there's the SafeBus or NightLine."
"A lot of the professors on campus are fairly relaxed. Registration was a breeze to get through! Class sizes are pretty small, meaning there are lectures but majority of the classes aren't set up this way. The workload depends on which professor you have; it typically ranges from reading a chapter a week to reading 1-2 chapters a day. However, there's plenty of help for any class; whether it's office hours, TAs, study groups, or tutoring. There will always be someone available to help you, don't be afraid to ask for help!"
"My major was Business (Accounting) and Cultural studies, with an emphasis on East Asian religion. The workload was pretty easy. My advice is to NEVER take chemistry and calculus within the same semester. With a business major, there is a building on campus, Summerfield Hall, that's specifically for business students; two words: GO THERE! They have a help room (absolutely free) that has saved lives/grades several times. It's literally a building filled with people who has been through the same courses that you are/will be taking & want to help. Also in that hall, they post facts, job employment opportunities, and anything else that is business related."
"Generally, KU is a predominantly white campus but there are representatives of every culture all around. Guys tend to be more relaxed than you would typically imagine on a college campus. The students are pretty friendly and willing to talk/help when approached. I've even ran into some of the basketball guys and they are extremely friendly as well. There isn't a secret dress code that everyone seems to be following, just dress how you want; whether that's pants in the summer or shorts during the winter (yes, I have seen this several times throughout the year). There are multiple interests so it's easy finding people who are more like you."
"I love the local atmosphere! Lawrence in general is a college town. There's downtown, ""Mass St."" with so many dining, shopping, and entertainment options. The cost of living is fairly average. The Granada is one of the main event attractions; we've had artists ranging from Christina Perri to Chance the Rapper and YG.Besides KU events, there aren't very many sporting events that happen. Overall, the scenery is beautiful and the people are generally very warm."
"Student life is great! The staff are warm, welcoming and really friendly throughout the whole campus.The libraries have unlimited resources and amenities available, the librarians are very helpful and willing to aid in any way they possibly can. The campus is pretty live, meaning there's always something going on around the campus to get involved in. At the very beginning of the school year, there's HawkWeek, specifically for freshman to get acquainted and mingle. The campus is filled with a lot of traditions."
"My program is fine, you get to meet a lot of people with the same major as you and that's always helpful."
Since I'm pre nursing its really just taking all the pre requisites for my major but its been fairly easy to get in to all the classes that I need for it.
"I love being here now as a student but am not entirely sure I would want to stay on much past that. Not that Lawrence isn't fun, I just think would want a new chapter in my life."
"The only time I can recall ever having sexual assault being brought up, every single person was notified through our school emails and so on so we all knew exactly what to be on the lookout for. Very helpful."
"Again, if you can't find it, you aren't looking. When in Lawrence I can almost always find not only what I want to eat, but find it available when I want to eat it as well."
"While I was annoyed with the blatant lack of aid that I received, I made an appointment with an advisor and after her helping me am now working on filling out the paper work I need to to be able to hopefully get the aid I'm looking for."
"I would say again that there is such a variety that if you don't find somewhere that you enjoy living, you really probably just didn't look."
"There really is always something going on in Lawrence, and we really do have such a wide variety of bars and things that there really is no reason to not be able to find some place you enjoy, unless you just seriously aren't looking."
"I would say that the level of strictness they enforce the rules with is right on, it sounds like it is comparable to the other schools around but isn't super ridiculously strict."
"I don't know any other school, at least not locally, that has the kind of pride for their basketball team that KU does. It's incredible and honestly moving to be in Allen field house during a game."
We have such a wide variety of food options I would be genuinely surprised if someone couldn't find a single thing that they wanted.
"I needing help figuring out what to do after the nursing school I applied to said my ACT score of 28 was expired and id have to retake it, and my KU advisor helped me find a major that overlapped with what I've been taking for pre nursing but also is its own major so I have something to show for all the school I've finished and maybe then with a major, I'll go pre med instead."
"I had a couple fairly close minded professors but that's how people are in any place, a couple will be. Overall, I love it here."
I am just getting more into my major this year. I am enrolled in more classes specifically for my major and am very excited about it.
"I feel that the school is just trying to keep everyone safe, even though some people may feel that they are ruining the fun."
Everyone has their own style and personality.
"Honestly, my parents helped a lot to take care of the process."
"There is always something going on in Lawrence, Kansas! Whether it's a party or a bar, students always come out to have a great time. The Hawk is especially popular on Wednesdays, also known as dollar night."
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I love my school and campus. I feel that there is always a lot to do and everything is very safe. I have made a great amount of friends and memories.
The University of Kansas has a great amount of school spirit. Going to sporting events are a great experience. I am definitely proud to be a Jayhawk!
I feel very safe on campus. I have never had any threatening incidents and neither have any of the close circle of friends.
"I really enjoyed all of my classes and most of my professors. Overall, I have had a great experience at the University of Kansas."
"Personally, I haven't looked much into this topic. I do believe there is a great affiliation though."
There is a great diversity on campus. I feel that everyone can connect.
"Oliver dining hall, which is the hall I lived in and ate at, was just okay. It was hard to find health options and the food didn't satisfy majority of the time. There were other dining halls on campus, like Mrs. E's that had a much larger variety of meals to choose from. It wasn't very convenient for me to get there often but I would occasionally find my way there."
Most people on campus are pretty down to earth and easy to get along with.
A great deal of international students come into KU ever semester. I have to admit that most people who go to KU are from some part of Kansas otherwise.
I immediately got a bit of financial aid from the school when I qualified for it through GPA and ACT exam scores. I managed to maintain my aid by managing to keep my GPA in the school over a certain level.
"I think the English and History program at the University of Kansas are both pretty good but I have to admit that I prefer one over the other. The English Department has many great classes that have all topics one could wish for in American, African- American, British, Irish, and Latin American literature. I have not taken one class which I've regretted taking later. The teachers are also very approachable. The History Program is about the same in most respects. The professors are really nice and they do offer a wide range of classes that deal with many places throughout the world but it is also quite limiting in a way. This is especially true for the capstone classes. There are only a few classes on very specific subjects that you can take each semester."
"I've never eaten in the dining halls but I hear they are terrible. Luckily there are a ton of options all over the city to eat, and many deliver."
Night life here is pretty great. Thursday nights are the best because there are so many drink specials and that's when everyone tends to go out. Mass is the place to be on Thursday nights.
Girls in this area are a little stuck up and can be huge partiers. But of course there are girls who aren't. Guys around here are pretty laid back.
"I'm not a greek, it is just not for me. Many of the people who are tend to be a little snobbish. Some of the houses are nice while others are pretty run down. Pledging is definitely not for everyone."
"Getting around the town can be a total nightmare, especially on game days. Many of the streets are small 2 lane roads that get jam packed with people and it can be impssible to turn into stores off the main streets."
"As a psychology major there are a lot of options to expand my education. There are a lot of research opportunities and many hospitals and other facilities in the area work with doctors and professors at KU, so it all coincides, which is really nice."
There is always something to do in an around the city. Lots of places to shop off Mass street and people are all pretty friendly to eachother.
There are multiple options and varieties off campus and there are a ton of places that deliver.
"There are more stuck-up guys than not, although there are some guys who are very friendly. Many smart guys here."
"Great place to live, but I am looking to experience other parts of the country as well."
"No matter how many times I try, I am unable to receive any financial aid, even though I need it."
"As as student with multiple dietary restrictions, it is nearly impossible to find a decent variety of food that I can eat. When there are meals for students with dietary needs, it's usually about three different meals total for the whole year. It is very hard to find things that I can eat."
Lots of different options for people who need special dietary needs or are looking for something different. Many late night options and many places have discounts for students.
"The department of student housing is not well run, there is a never-ending process to get everything correct and those in charge abuse their power more often than not."
"House parties and bars, like any college. I'm not a big part of that kind of life."
Lots of different people from many different backgrounds.
Basketball brings the entire campus together.
It depends on the internship you are awarded.
"Super easy to get in, and not hard to stay in."
Could be a lot better about lawn work.
Lots of variety. Easy and flexible scheduling
Everything is customized for you. You feel like you have your own learning plan
No warning when new ones are posted
Ku does very well maintaining their facilities
I've never lived off campus but my friends have
You get away with a lot
You fit in where you fit in
I think awareness would make the sexual assault decline
Everything you need is on mass street
I love ku classes. I have a bond with my teachers and ask them questions and go see them in their office for further questions
I just eat at home most of the time
"Campus strictness is the perfect middle, where it's not super strict where you don't wanna be there but you also know & feel that everyone cares for you! KU has an AMAZING atmosphere"
KU is definitely more of a bar scene then house parties! On the weekend & even on Wednesday's most students are either at the bars or the frats!
The local restaurants in downtown Lawrence are awesome!!!
"I am all for Greek life, especially at my school!! I didn't go greek my freshman year & I still very much enjoyed their parties & went to a few events! Going into my sophomore year I am definitely going to join! Although greek life is kind of big at my school, if you're not apart of it, you won't feel left out! Half of my friend group is greek & the other half is non greek! I recommend trying it out & if it's not for you, it's biggie!"
"Although I haven't been in every building on campus as I was only a freshman this past school year, the quality of our school is very top notch & up to date, at least in my eyes!"
"Like every town, there will be some sort of sexual assault but I honestly feel very safe on my campus!"
"We again, literally have everything from singles, doubles, 2 & 4 person suits, to on-campus apartments! Everyone is sure to find their perfect fit!"
"There are many different races & ethnicities on campus but they are obviously still he minority, but being apart of the minority I don't feel as though I am treated any different!"
I personally only got $600 my freshman year so not much but if you have good grades & act/say you will get some sort of scholarship! KU is a pretty pricey school for out of state students but it's well worth it!
"There is literally something for everyone, there are the cheap, not so nice apparments that students usually opt for that are in close proximity to the football stadium and then there are the average priced nicer appartments that are a good 5-10 minute walk from campus & most of the bars and then there are the more pricey fully furnished apartments that are alittle farther (walking wise) to campus, so there is honestly something for everyone!"
"I honestly love the town of Lawrence, so much so that I want to retire there later in the future!!!"
KU basketball - what else can I say? The football team hasn't been doing great lately but games are still fun to go to. Sporting events bring the student body together and are the only time you are surrounded by a hundred other students with such enthusiasm. I don't care about sports but at KU it's hard to ignore how fun the games are as a social event.
"It's pretty average. Nothing really stands out. The rec is good, but I don't go there because it's always so packed. The machines are always taken. The libraries are a hugely popular study spot, but I prefer the computer labs because they're less populated and free. Engineering students have free unlimited printing, which is amazing."
"Watkins is great. It's SO much better than LMH (Lawrence Memorial Hospital) and is open almost every day. The staff is so friendly. Sometimes appointments are hard to get, it just depends on the time of year and the day of the week. The walk-in clinic also varies with waiting time. The pharmacy is very convenient and the staff is very helpful."
There's so much to choose from. Lots of places deliver and most places are open late. You can use your KU card to pay for most food in town. There are lots of local places that are often overlooked but just as good as the chain restaurants. Lawrence is very vegetarian-friendly!
"I love KU. I probably wouldn't change my decision to come here if I could go back in time. However, I do sometimes wish I had gone to a 2-year school first and transferred here. The intro-level courses are definitely weed-out classes here. Once you get past the weed-outs it's not too bad, but it's very easy for your GPA to suffer if you're not careful."
"Guys are either really fratty, really nerdy, or totally hipster. There's not much else. Most people are in greek life and act stuck-up and spoiled rich. The people who aren't in greek life are great. Most people are shy but friendly if you approach them first."
"KU is very diverse, but everyone pretty much sticks to what they know. There aren't really diverse friendships between students on campus. People don't seem to intermix here."
"The dorms are pretty run-down and old. Elevators are constantly broken and lobbies are constantly vandalized and trashed. But I don't really know what else you would expect from a bunch of college freshmen. It's easy to find a place to live. The buses are always going between the dorms and classes, so it's very easy to get around. Everything is also within walking distance, but there are lots of hills."
"No matter what day of the week it is, there's always a party in Lawrence. There are many places close to campus, and other places that aren't too close or too far."
"In the evenings and nights it's hard to find stuff to eat on campus. The dining halls have okay food, but the Underground or the Union are better, when they're open. Everything is pretty expensive because it's convenient. Lawrence is very vegetarian-friendly."
"Greek life is so huge at KU. If you're not involved, it's hard to make friends or find decent parties to go to. Greeks are snobby and think they're better than you. I took an economics class and I was one of 2 non-Greeks in the entire class. Everyone in the class already knew each other and nobody was willing to talk to me, even for our required group projects in the class. They don't even tell you how to join until after it's too late."
"There are so many places to choose from, in so many different neighborhoods. Between apartments, townhomes, houses, and other options, there is something for everyone. It's not hard at all to find an affordable place to live with the amenities you want, and a location that works for you!"
The dorms are prices way to high for the quality and space of the dorms.
"They guys at my school are majority attractive and interesting. The dress like another American male would. The social life usually include partying. They typical girls wear leggings, Sharks t-shirt, and Sperry's shoes.They are usually interested in either guys, drama, or partying. There seems to be good and bad sides to each relationship."
"The campus life at KU is awesome. Everyone has an equal opportunity to experience, share, and get involved in it. The social scene is always steadily expanding. There is a place for everyone to engage in deep discussions or light chit chat."
Life on on campus is always lively. You can tell that students and staff want to be there more than anywhere else. They come and stay which means that they are enjoying life at KU.
"The campus is well suited for an excellent college lifestyle experience. There is plenty of help to guide you and well light seating areas. What makes KU unique is its warm social atmosphere. Anyone can find a healthy outlet to express themselves whether its a club, a sport, a church, or spending time talking with friends."
"The off-campus housing selection is varied, and the school is accommodating with regards to helping others find off-campus housing."
"There is a significant emphasis on taking sexual assaults seriously, and taking preventive measures against sexual assault."
"""Diversity"" a vague term, encompassing any number of possible attributes among a population. Nevertheless, it would be fair to say that the school has at least a moderate level of ""diversity."""
"Biased in my evaluation, but I would say almost everyone here is obsessed with ""Greek life"". Everyone is gathered in cliques centralized around Greek life, and if you didn't come to college with previous social acquaintances, especially those involved with Greek life, you might as well be a social pariah for all these snobs care."
"Granted, I'm biased in my evaluation, but I'm a first-generation student coming from a low socioeconomic background, and the school has yet to provide adequate aid so that I can continue to attend."
"Overall, the department and program has a positive reputation. I have yet to really get involved in the program, so I cannot really speak to what it's like at this point in time."
"Liberal arts courses are supposed to have a reputation for highly respected professors. This is primarily because many philosophers within these departments emphasize critical thinking, logical argument, and thorough evaluation and/or revision of written text. I cannot speak for the science or math professors, as I have taken very few science and math courses at this point in time."
"My counselor guides me through the process of getting my major requirements in tack, but still its a little confusing on what classes to take and what counts, what doesn't. I can't do it on my own i have to have help from a counselor."
Everyone is accepted at this college. Everyone helped everyone out if their lost. The people in the helps rooms are very helpful to anyone.
When I go on campus I rarely see friends getting together. Everyone just goes to class and then goes home or goes to the library to study. No one has time to see friends during the school week.
"It was a hassle but I got my financial aid. It's through the computer and I don't like that because you have to check your email a lot to see if you got the financial aid email and you have to accept it and then go on the university website to read and make sure I actually got it. It's very confusing, but I got what I needed."
"The local atmosphere is alright. I'm not crazy about the area, and the town to me is run-down and shabby."
"Safety on campus is fairly average, I don't feel particularly unsafe, mainly only at night."
The guys that seem to be around campus are pretty nice. Many of the students are finding themselves and trying to figure out where they are going in their careers and lives. I prefer when a guy has an idea of where he is headed.
"My major is unique. I am in the PharmD program and the workload is tough, but there are many internship and job opportunities."
"The academics are fine, probably comparable to other colleges. The registration process, or any administrative task in general is a nightmare."
An advantage to off-campus housing is that there is a bus that students can take to get to and from campus for free.
KU has a very diverse campus with many organizations and clubs that encourage diversity.
tons of new places to eat !
i feel safe on campus
"its college student living, its average"
I love the professors who teach art history courses and the different classes given are extremely interesting
I love the professors who teach art history courses and the different classes given are extremely interesting
"the clubs to join at Ku are overwhelming there are so many, it's great !"
"acceptance among many different groups of people is a big part of life at KU. lawrence is a very accepting, loving city"
"It's not eaasy getting money from people, but If you put in the effort, many times you'll get rewarded"
"I personally would never join a greek, and i've witnessed first hand how cruel and ignorant frat boys and sorority girls can be. on the other hand i have a lot of friends in greek life, and they're some of the best friends ive ever had"
"I feel that KU is in a city of itself, people who do not attend KU said that when the breaks come around, that the city is quite and nothing is happening. In Lawrence it is amazing when there are a lot of people roaming throughout the city. Shopping is alright a person has a better chance of going to the Oak Park Mall and finding something good then shopping in lawrence. Other then the shopping Lawrence, KS you can always find something to do."
"Living on campus is definitely great, for me all I had to do was catch a bus to class or even walk depending on the weather. I lived close to campus which was great but it wasnt close to society. I mean I lived in a all girls dorm and yes it was difficult but it wasn't as bad as it could've been, I met a lot of girls from everywhere. I made friends quite easily. I also... would put out there that even though my residence hall wasnt bad I would never recommend to live, it was alright and it was cheap but it wouldn't have been my first choice"
"I genuinely thought at first that I would be scared and not able to handle going away from home and being a big kid. After I got comfortable the University was one of the best decisions that I could've made. I loved meeting all these new people that I would've never met otherwise. It was definitely an experience, but I am glad that even though i had some bad experiences my good experiences outweighed them. I cannot wait until August to continue my experiences"
"I feel that the dining hall was great on certain days, because it was some days that the food was not good and I would just not eat. On other days it would be great. The good thing about your KU card was you could use it as a credit card, for example Dominos would take your Cuisine Cash as actual money, which is great for us broke college students. Buffalo Wild Wings used your Beak'em Bucks if you didnt want to carry cash around. I'm just waiting on chipotle to get on that card usage"
"The reason I believe that off-campus dining was okay, is because it was the same thing over and over. Even though they had a GREAT discounts for KU students, I just feel like it took a lot of money to eat when we could've just have eaten in the room and saved money."
"The guys and girls.... Well it is a lot of people from every where, some of them are well off and dress better with nicer cars interested in rush week or getting phenomenal grades. Looking like models on campus while on the other hand there are the people like me, who are not the wealthiest yet not the poorest. I feel like we were the ones who were relaxed yet trying to make good grades because we know this isn't the cheapest things for our parents, we may not have looked phenomenal everyday but atleast we were in class."
"The diversity is... Something I was definitely not used to. I went to a predominately black high school and to be the one of the only African American person in a class was weird. It was also a fun time, I gained lots of other friends from this. I learned a lot about cultures. As stated before it is what you make it."
"I felt that the University of Kansas was a great social scene as well as academic.

They definitely know how to have a good time but when it comes down to academic they make sure you have all the help you needed, I wish I would've used them more"
"I had so much fun this first year. The library, I can't believe I am saying this was one of the most interesting places. I think that it actually helped me stay focused. I feel that the weekends are always the best because it is always something to do. Traditions night made me really feel like a Jayhawk, I learned a lot as well as had fun. I definitely think that student life depends on the person, you have to emerge yourself into it or it wont be fun at all."
"There are many options around campus should you choose to live there. It's great to have your own place plus, more than half the time it would be cheaper than living on campus. The only real con would be having to accommodate time for getting to class."
"There are many things to do on campus. SUA hosts many events to help give out information about clubs, sports, frats and sororities. Even if you are not a big social person there are plenty of spots around campus to just hang out with a friend and enjoy the day with. There should not be a reason to not find something to do other than you do not want to do anything."
"Basketball is really big here, even though you might not be a big sports fan, just tuning into the game with a couple of buddies can really give you a sense of what is like to be a jay-hawk."
Living on campus is a great way to transition into the college life as you have plenty of people on the same boat as you as well as RA's that know how to help you should you need it.
"A lot of people date in college. Every where I go, I see a couple holding hands."
"This last semester was pretty rough, academically speaking. College life is pretty fun because you meet a lot of new people and it's awesome."
I mostly stay on campus but I probably cant answer these question well. But I know that you get a discount if you are a KU student at Dominos and Glory Days.
I don't mean to stereotype but there are a lot of people from South America and China that go to KU. But that's great. It's awesome to see and meet new people.
"Of course, they are strict on the obvious stuff, such as underage drinking and quiet hours. Other than that, they are pretty chill."
"The food is actually pretty good. For the scholarship hall, they cook their own food but for the dorms, they have a dine-in cafe. , which has a variety of food, form Mexican to Chinese to salads. It's pretty good too."
Everybody knows that KU has one of the best basketball programs. So the empasis on basketball is very much important.
"Actually, it all depends where you stay. From what I heard, I know some of the dorms are in pretty bad shape. But if you stay in the scholarship halls, like Krebhiel, they are not that bad. Even though they are called scholarship halls, they are still high. I normally take the buses to classes because it would be a really long walk."
"Every once in a while, you hear about the ""stranger-danger"" on campus or a shooting at a bar. But those are expected to happen because there are some nuts in this world. But about 80% of the time, KU is a very nice place to lived."
I wish more places delivered!!!! FOR STUDYING TIME
I like everything! Popular study areas are the libraries!
There is a lot of opportunity in the psychology department to excel.
Some thing were okay in my dining hall but mainly I did not enjoy it
Things happen that we all wish wouldn't but overall I felt safe but they may also be because nothing has happened to me to believe otherwise.
I had a good experience in my dorm.
They are helpful but it can be difficult at times. I wish there was more money available to students at times because the cost of schooling is outrageous.
Some things are strict but I would not consider it a strict place to be. You are in control of yourself.
I love lawrence on mass street
"I rushed my freshmen year and did not join a house. If you are at a bar everyone will ask you what house you are in and when you say you are not in one they give you a look like, oh well ok.... wish that would change a little."
"Looks are good, interests are very diverse, dressing styles are casual but nice as well, and social life is always hopping. There are people in relationships and some not just depends on the person."
It bisically has to do with having a good GPA of at least 3.0 and doing good in the courses that are related to your major
It involves a lot of discipline and hard work to succeed since the courses are very challenging and hectic
It pretty much does not take the average KU student into consideration like the on campus dining halls do
The availability of modern technology in the classroom helps to make learning easier and more fun. Lecturers are able to impact knowledge easily because of the level of technology at the school
Involves a lot of calculations and there is no room for error which makes it ally tough on students. Workload is always a lot because there re always assignments given and research work to be done. Internships and job opportunities are available for students and it is an easy way to gain experience and knowledge in one's field of study
living on campus is always a great experience because students get a variety of dorms to live in with different prices and amenities. Also students get the chance to interact with people from all walks of live and make friends that last a life time. Social atmosphere is always fun .There are always parties or events going on on campus and it is easy for students to attend these events because of the availability of transportation on campus.
A variety of meals are always available to students throughout the week in different dining halls which makes it easy for students to get access to food.
"For international students,Scholarship opportunities are limited which makes it difficult for most international students to get enough aid financially"
"At the University of Kansas , people accept you for who you are and respect one's views and ideas irrespective of who one is and where the person comes from."
If you are not white you experience is limited
We do get some discounts but not many.
Everyone is pretty much on the same page about religion.
Everyone kind of dresses the same but it looks good.
Drugs are not abundant but available if u seek it.
"If you like the full effect of each season, you're in good hands."
"Good people, just don't be stupid and you're fine."
Lawrence is known to have great food and there are so many places that everyone can find somewhere they like.
"You shouldn't go anywhere alone at night obviously but if you do, it is no big deal because you should be okay."
"KU parking is not good at all, there is always so much construction."
We do a lot of community service and things for the campus but also know how to have fun.
"One of the best decisions I have ever made, I went Greek and I think everyone should."
The campus is beautiful but there aren't many green spaces to hang out.
"Definitely KU basketball, there's nothing like it."
"I love it so much, and it will be really rewarding."
Getting into the nursing program is hard - KU has one of the best in the country.
"School with one of the highest drop out rates because it is pretty difficult, freshman year is definitely full of weed out classes."
It stinks that the nursing school is not in Lawrence so being a pre-nursing major means not doing anything nursing related at all.
"A very social school with a prominent Greek life, go Greek."
Not diverse at all. All white people.
A bus is a bus
Sports are huge here. Too bad I don't care about them.
My major is pre med. It exist and doesn't exist at the same time.
There a good teachers and terrible teachers. Teach yourself everything and teach others.
Mass street is awesome and huge.
A computer is absolutely necessary. Almost everything is online.
I have been to an off campus apt or house
It's awesome. I did not want to leave for the summer.
People do drugs and alcohol. I don't feel any peer pressure to do anything. I could care less. I'm not sure of what policy the school has with drugs.
"I'm still a little new to campus, but everyone is very inviting and supportive."
"Downtown is the best place to go for eating out. Since it's right next to campus, it's convenient, but sometimes things can get pricey."
"There are lots of different people on campus. People vary by age, race, orientation--it's great to see a well-balanced community instead of everyone conforming to each other."
"I don't like partying late at night because it can get a little too loud for me. It's fun watching people have a good time downtown, though."
"Snow happens a lot during the winters here. Campus is hardly closed unless the weather is extreme, which is rare. I don't like driving or being in the snow, so I wish they would consider closing more."
Lots of choices to eat--so many that it's hard to choose some days. A little pricey here and there but it's worth it.
"Wi-fi is pretty reliable on campus. Paying for printing is a pain, since not all of us have to print out loads of paper. I wish it were free."
I'm a born and raised Lawrencian and I don't think anything could change my mind about living here. KU's campus makes it even better--it's so pretty.
Sexual orientations are widely accepted on campus. There are many resources and social events to participate in.
The free bus rides to campus are great. It saves money and helps the environment.
"There is a lot of school spirit on campus. We have a lot of reasons to be proud of our campus, and we show it."
"At my sister's graduation, there was a lot of wine, beer, and champagne drinking. Bottles and corks were everywhere."
"I don't hear much about violence, although it does happen at parties."
"It is a great program, they are opening the new business school in like 2 or 3 more years."
"If you're looking for an A, the workload can get pretty heavy, but if you like to settle for C's then you'll get by with minimal effort."
"Speed is great everywhere in computer labs except in dorms, it can get pretty slow."
"Campus life is alright, just make sure to make friends in your lobby, that will lead to even more friends!"
"Rec center is pretty cool, better than all the gyms around and libraries are pretty relaxing."
"If you live in the dorms, the bus will literally take you to classes, and have access to other buses that will take you other places such as walmart."
It would be much better if the Greek Fraternities would actually allow non-greek guys to attend their parties.
"You can find most of places on mass street, and there is often coupons for some places. After 10pm, you'll probably have to settle for a chain restaurant."
"McCollum is an okay place, there is the most people and I feel like you can get away with a lot as long as you don't create too much attention to yourself."
"All you need is a fake id, to have the most fun here, if not just wait for random house parties."
"It is not too strict, anyone can visit you as long as they provide their state id"
"Great during summer and fall, but during spring and winter it can get pretty cold."
"It's a great school, however as an Hispanic student sometimes I feel left out as majority of students are Caucasian."
I wouldn't have chosen any other school.
Our school revolves around athletics. The players are like celebrities. They facilities are great even if you aren't an athlete.
"There are so many things to do. Shopping on Mass, or going to a baseball game, or out to eat. You could never be bored."
I think the tradition at KU sets us apart. It's so rich and no other school is like it.
"Part of the reason I chose KU was because of the setup of the school, and how beautiful every part of it is."
There are a lot of computer labs. The internet is slow when a lot of people are working.
The nightlife is awesome. It just gets old after a while.
There is so much variety that has reasonable pricing for college students.
There is a lot of variety which offers a lot to fulfill a living situation.
"The busses come every so often, and because it isn't a huge town they can go all over."
It's a great place to meet new people. The janitors did a very good job of keeping it clean.
The diversity is great! Everywhere I look it's diverse.
"I didn't have to deal with very much, but I know they care about our safety."
I want to be a nurse and wish I could stay at the main university all four years. I have to have great grades to get into the nursing school and it is very competitive.
They have a variety of classes to take.
"There were hardly ever spots, and ticketing was a little to expensive for a broke college student."
"There is lots of variety, it just gets old fast."
It also is the students' responsibility to leave with a friend so things don't happen to them because if the police can't be there then a least a friend can try and help.
"Lots of computers aroud. Mainly in the library, but you can get to a computer if you really need one for hard work within 10 minutes if you're on campus. The first two weeks back from summer or a major break, can stress the network, because everyone is trying to log on at the same time."
"This is a large public school, you can study almost anything you want."
"As an engineer, a lot is expected. The engineering career center seems great, I haven't used them to their full potential."
"Lawrence has a lot of public transit, and if you're too lazy to walk to class, wake up a bit earlier and catch the bus. There are plenty of stops, and they make a round about every 15 min."
Very college town. Has it's own character. Hard to not like.
"NE Kansas is known for crazy weather. One day it'll be 19 degrees and snowing, next day 60 and sunny. Gets annoying often, but better than constant snow and cold, or rain, or blistering heat and sun."
"It's college, cute girls, handsome males, and anything in between. Look hard enough play your cards right you'll get lucky."
"Lawrence is full of good food. Especially if you're vegan/vegeterian/pescetarian. I joke that I have to search for the ""meat menu"" sometimes because it seems catered to vegeterians. (Careful, on campus is hit and miss on this category) Price ranges are all over the place, to satisfy what your wallet needs. Lots of places have delivery, and if you're feeling extremely lazy/rich, there is a ""food taxi"" you can pay for."
"Night life is what you make of it. If you're a male who's not in greek life, there goes a huge party source, you're not going to get in really unless you know guys from there. Females basically have free reign, they get into bars easier. Honestly, the harder you try to party the more you'll be rewarded, don't let your grades slack. Sometimes I get sick of it."
"The cost is just about right, selecting your housing is extremely easy once you get the portal to work (KU seems to love Firefox - if you're having trouble, cycle through browsers, starting with Firefox)."
"Mass Street has the most diverse offerings for dining. Cost is always good, and the food is to die for! I always recommend The Burger Stand or Zen Zero for food options."
"I come from a barely middle class family with two siblings and two working parents and only received one scholarship (which I lost) for $5,000 a year based on my ACT score of 32. However, the GPA requirement is 3.4, and I earned a 3.16, and I feel that I was punished for taking mostly honors classes and receiving slightly lower grades than I would have with regular classes."
"Knew a few kids who got kicked out for drug possession. I don't do drugs but it isn't glamorous by any means, and is pretty much consistent with the drug usage and visibility there was at my high school."
Always windy on the hill.
"Since it's in Kansas, there's still less diversity than the coasts. However, KU is great about making international students blend in and feel at home, and everyone is generally accepting of everyone else's religious and political backgrounds, as well as financial means."
"Daisy Hill is the main location for dorms, and the social life is great up there. There's always someone to go to when you're bored or need someone to talk to, so it's really a close knit atmosphere."
Always something to do/a bar to go to during the year. And the university provides SafeBus/SafeRide to get students around safely.
Their job counseling is great and the advisors rock.
"It's dorm food, so it's not spectacular and sometimes it seems repetitive but for the first semester and a half it's great."
"It's KU basketball season year-round. From recruitment to pre-season Late Night In the Phog to game days and March Madness, KU has such a rich history with the program that it's hard not to get sucked into it."
Depends how far you are from campus and the tenants that came before you.
"The Honors Program is one of the most selective and oldest programs for honors in the nation, and they are constantly willing to help their students. I am confident in my professors' abilities to assist me or direct me where I can receive assistance, and classes are no joke but are incredibly rewarding when hard work is put in."
"Not entirely sure on the response for this, but a few campus alerts have been sent out regarding sexual assault which is a little unsettling."
"Buses do a fantastic job of getting around campus, and Lawrence transit buses are free to students with proof of enrollment (i.e. student ID card). The drivers are usually personable and keep the buses clean, and restrict open containers to maintain this clean environment. Bus routes are clearly displayed and usually run on time, barring severe weather."
"Greek life is pretty big but almost anyone can be accepted into any house. Essentially Greek girls wear really bummy clothes and Greek guys always wear khakis and some kind of button-down. I personally have never held an interest in Greek life, and KU didn't do a convincing job of making it look glamorous. But apparently the parties are good."
The athletics at the school is pretty great and the quality is top notch. I've heard great things about the rec center and the intramural teams. The school spirit is high and very proud.
There have been a lot of sexual assaults and the like on campus and yes they have emailed and sent out information on it but as far as catching them not so much as least to my knowledge. Not only that I don't really feel comfortable walking by myself later in the evening because a lot of these occurences happen later in the night and I've been called incredibly derogatory slurs while walking alone and am sometimes afraid of people acting out of that because no-one is around. Other than that I do see police often patrolling during the day and the number of emergency boxes around campus is a good amount.
The number of off-campus dining places is pretty decent and accessible. There's usually enough offers floating around that getting a nice size meal for lunch or dinner so it isn't hard to find something that's nice to eat. I haven't been to many places off campus but the two that I have been to were excellent. Ramen Bowls is by far the best place I've been to that serves ramen and the staff is great not to mention they are fast with the to-go orders. Don Don is another place I've been to and it's a great price for such a big bowl. Also if Asian isn't your thing they have tons of other places to order from take out or not.
"The labs/computer spaces available are limited depending on the time of day and the time in the semester. Not only that when I've been in the library when my computer is down it's the computers are usually filled up or a good chunk won't turn on and it leaves few spots. As far as wifi goes, when you are on campus the wifi is pretty decent but in the dorms it's horrible a times. The speed is absolutely horrible especially for the price I'm paying to live in the dorms it's ridiculous."
There's generally a bus for every part of Lawrence whether your going downtown or needing to head to Walmart but outside of Lawrence there isn't a whole of transportation options. Not only that the schedule is slightly hard to read for someone that has never had to take the public bus before.
Sometimes you have to park far away because everyone else is already there even if you are an hour early for your class.
The campus police is mostly older men so sometimes I don't feel as safe as I could feel.
Mostly everyone at the school is very friendly and most will just come up and introduce themselves.
My campus strictness is mostly lenient about most things but if it is bothering or harming others it will be stopped by campus police.
Drugs can be found everywhere so there is no need to talk about it.
i never see campus security at night
They ignore the underage drinking and crack down on stupid stuff like parking
not many cute guys and way more guys then girls in greek life
not very helpful with giving scholarships or any aid
a lot of professors are foreign making it hard to understand material
there is nothing like allen field house
i dont live on campus
very helpful and on time
Some of the teachers are foreign and very hard to understand.
I live in apartments that are not affiliated with the school.
its very cold and windy in the winter
Competitive admission makes you work hard and not slack off
I like school a lot
"I live in an awful, unsafe apartment complex and it is outrageously priced"
Lots of things to try if you are willing to go out on a limb
Lots of things to do
"I don't use the labs a lot but the wifi is everywhere, just occasionally slow"
"The buses are free and usually on time if they are the on-campus routes. If it is off campus, prepare to be early and wait awhile and never know which one"
"Walking around outside is what we do, if you aren't prepared, you are going to be exposed to the weather. If you just check the forecast, there is no issues, other than when it is blistering cold"
I have to show up early just to make sure I find a spot and get to class on time
They are pretty stand-offish and unfriendly.
There are a lot of wonderful options near campus!
"Greek life is very active, but doesn't dominate the social scene. The Greek houses are big and gorgeous! It was not the right fit for me, however I have friends who loved their experience."
"I'm from Dallas, TX, so the winter season feel especially harsh. The Spring and Autumn season are gorgeous on campus! Summers are hot."
"Shuttle buses come around frequently. I have a car when needed, but it's not necessary for getting around campus. I usually walk to all my classes. The only time when it becomes difficult is when it's freezing outside!"
I am in Greek Life so I am biased but I am extremely please with it here at KU.
Buses are very convenient and run through campus stopping at various locations. SafeBus is also very nice.
Lawrence is the most liberal town in Kansas and the majority of students are moderate or liberal I think.
"Lawrence has fantastic restaurants on Mass street, something for everyone."
"Athletics are huge at KU, the rec center is great but it gets pretty crowded, could be bigger."
"Kansas City less than an hour away makes for great shopping and professional sports teams, not to mention nightlife. Most townies that live in Lawrence love the school."
"Lots of options for whoever wants to live off campus. Some houses look pretty shabby, but most students don't care about that."
I don't have any concerns finding an internship in accounting.
I am very happy with the business school so far in my experience.
Drinking is apparent during the weekends but nobody cares if you don't partake.
Lots of diversity on campus.
The busses cannot get up the hill if the streets are iced.
Most living areas on campus are great to live in.
Don't smoke in the dorms.
If you're not at the hawk you're missing out.
Currently undecided but my advisors great!
Live in an apartment if you can.
Night busses and other options available so students can avoid driving under the influence.
Strict about parking - get a pass ASAP!
Tons of choices! Just ask around but pretty much anywhere is good.
"If you go to KU, expect to cheer for KU"
Wifi is terrible in the dorms.
Don't live off campus but they seem reasonably priced and they promote a lot on campus
Parking is bad I've heard. But I walk to campus and avoid the issue completely.
I live within walking distance of campus and don't do much driving.
Top law school. Top professors with real world work experience. Innocence Project. Rigorous academics.
"Helpful, kind, open-minded, supportive, friendly, open"
I found very cheap housing within a 1/2 mile of campus. Application process is easy with all apartments I've applied to. Very affordable with flexible options.
"KU has a laid back feel to it. The atmosphere is academically rigorous but laid back enough that you feel comfortable approaching all professors and staff with any issue at all. Staff is extremely supportive with any issue brought to their attention, academic or otherwise."
"Lawrence, KS is a small town with a big city feel. Food isn't the most diverse I've ever seen, but it isn't lacking by any means either. Barbecue food here is the best."
"The staff at University of Kansas are kind, helpful and go above and beyond to assist students in securing funding/scholarships to cover the cost of tuition. Go Jayhawks!"
Even though my soon to be off- campus housing is farther away than wanted to all the ammenities are amazing and the housing is perfect and well kept.
I'm always known with where a bus stop is and know that most of the buses i can ride are always accessible to me.
My housing is one of the best dorms you can stay in and is always well kept.
"I think it's safe around here since i see campus police everywhere, and Watkins health center is right on campus."
"The bus system not only goes from campus, but it also moves around town so it's easy to commute around Lawrence."
"Some of the buildings here are old, but they try to fix some of the problems."
There are a lot of different types of people here on campus
Ku basketball is pretty much the main thing to talk about on campus.
I would say the the strictness on campus would be average.
There's a lot of local shops here in Lawrence on Mass street that are much different than what you would expect
Its a struggle with the competition to maintain a scholarship.
"This is hands on training, and you get a good education."
The only difficult part of getting into computer engineering is math.
Academics are great and there are so many options of classes to take.
"I don't think campus is super strict. there are probably some things they could be more strict on like alcohol and noise, but other than that I think the campus is good as is."
"The safety is great.

I am so not impressed with the health center. I took my roommate to get tested for strep and the lady took the throat culture with out gloves after having hacked into her hands not even 5 minutes before. I only saw an RN when I got a shot. The worst thing is that they say they work with all insurances but that's a total lie. One of my worst experiences has been at the health center."
Lawrence is awesome and has so much more to offer than just the university. It's nice to be able to get out and explore town to take a break from studying.
I am super happy with my biology program. The only thing I would change is to have a set advisor for me specifically.
"There are so many majors to choose from, it is crazy. I'm not really planning on taking an internship, but i'm liable to shadow at the local medical center."
Lawrence has so many options for food and Mass Street is barely a mile away from campus so it's a fairly nice walk... if you like hills.
"We take a ""course"" online at the beginning of Freshman year or every year if you're Greek. Lots of people smoke on campus and there were some drug users in the dorms. The boys' side of the dorm smelled horribly of weed, but the girls' side of my floor didn't really do drugs to my knowledge."
"It's campus housing. It was what I expected it to be. It might have been different in a different dorm, but I don't really know."
"I'm not Greek, so I don't really know anything about Greek life."
"The bus system at KU is pretty awesome. Sometimes the buses can be really crowded, but as long as you don't mind being squished for a few minutes they work great."
"Okay parking sucks. On campus parking is outrageously expensive and there is only 1 lot for the lowest paying option. (which is the only one students can purchase). otherwise you're looking at parking in someone's driveway or pretty far away from campus. Supposedly they are going to be fixing the parking when they begin the master plan, but in the meantime i think parking is going to become even harder to find."
"There are several computer labs on campus, but they can get fairly crowded, especially during lunch. The wireless on campus is great and every building on campus is covered by the Jayhawk network. My only real complaint would be the price of printing. I think it's $0.40 per page, which isn't terrible, but when you need to print a 10 page paper on campus you're spending 4 bucks."
"It could be 70 degrees one day, and then there would be snow on the ground the next day. The weather is insane."
Don't expect a lot apart from loans through your parents.
There are people of all types here. You can find just about one of everyone.
There are plenty of majors to choose from; a great amount of those in engineering.
"From what I've seen, everyone here really wants to help you out and see to it that you get a good education and career."
You can't go to this school without being a fan. You will hear everything about everything that has to do with the sports.
"I've never had any real issues or concerns over this topic. I don't live on campus, therefore I'm not highly familiar with the system."
"The bus routes are great and go by every lecture building on campus. You do, however have to buy a permit to park in the spot where the buses pick up mass groups."
They pick me up at my dorm and take me to all of my classes.
"Technology is wonderful. I have my own computer, but I print it to the main printer in the dorm."
I want to become a doctor and do research to help solve the massive problem of diabetes in the United States.
"I have a lot of work, but I feel that I can achieve the goals that I have set for myself."
"I spend most of my time studying, so I don't get that much time to enjoy the nightlife."
"My father lost his job a few years ago, so it is really hard for my parents to help me pay for any of my college. I just wish that the university would look at the whole picture."
I find my way around campus no matter what the weather is on a particular day.
"I don't know about drugs specifically, but alcohol is a major problem. Everywhere I look, students are drinking and partying."
"I guess the academic experience has been alright so far. My grades have been good, and we are finally getting to the more interesting classes in my major. Dealing with the school itself, filling out forms, making phone calls, etc. has been terrible and it makes the school very unappealing."
"When we had a bunch of snow this year, the lack of plowing was comical around campus. My group of friends and I would make a footprint trail on West Campus and stay in the same path each day. If the area was taken care of, it was still a sheet of ice."
I have yet to be to an athletic event. Most students take part in some sort of involvement with athletics. Either participating or simply going to the games.
"I use public transportation and it has been a wonderful experience. The campus buses are great as well. Finding a bus stop that the particular buses stop at is a little confusing, but overall it is okay."
"Printing is a disaster at this school, and there is little hope of finding an open computer."
"I do not live on campus, but what I've seen of the amenities, I believe the dorms are just typical dorms. All the buildings on campus should really be updated though."
"It was an awful process dealing with the financial aid office. I feel like a one-phone-call issue ends up being about twelve phone calls. If as a student, you are American, your parents have jobs, or you have a job... you won't receive many scholarships. And no one in the financial aid office could tell me deadlines, or even get scholarship checks processed in a timely manner."
"Very expensive for a parking pass, and very limited spaces. Also a hassle to get from one point to the other on campus."
"There are so many events to go to every weekend. Whether you want to go out to the bars or hang out downtown Lawrence, there is always things to do."
Printers are available at all libraries and wifi throughout the campus. It makes being able to do homework very easy and adds to my academic success.
"I am a part of Greek Life and I think it adds so much to the community, both locally and nationwide. There is not excessive partying and I personally believe it makes a big campus a smaller community for all who are involved."
There is all different people from different backgrounds that make KU very diverse and a place where anyone can find there place.
Sometimes the buses are on time and other times the buses are very inconvenient and walking is the best option.
"There are days when campus is absolutely beautiful and it is an amazing atmosphere, especially in the fall. In the winter it sometimes gets depressing and it can sometimes get difficult to stay motivated."
The applications are straight forward and only contain the information that is necessary to what you are applying for.
"KU has an awesome program for any major. The class work is very difficult, but in the appropriate amount of time is applied, anyone can be very successful."
"Alcohol is as prevalent as it is on other campus', but if you do not drink, there is still plenty of other things to get involved in and do."
KU is extremely expensive and the people who give out loans expect my family to pay much more of my tuition than what is possible. It can be frustrating.
Internships are very competitive. They are practically a full-time job on top of school. I plan to look for an internship involving exercise science or PT to help further my academic career
"Love everything that I have learned so far. My career is pretty inflated right now, so my only concern would be finding a place looking for a PT"
Lots of Greeks running around campus. They seem to love it.
lots of student involvement during basketball season. A ton of school spirit in the spring (march madness). Athletic facilities are nice
"Always something going on. If you're bored, its your own fault"
Love my classes. Curriculum is great. Registration can be frustrating.
Lots of bus transportation all over lawrence
It all depends on the season. The middle of winter & summer can make for some uncomfortable walks on campus. Usually mild during other parts of the year
library can be crowded around midterms & finals.
A lot of security driving around campus. Walking between buildings can be intimidating due to lack of light. There have also been some off-campus attacks on women in the last 6 months
"Great community. Friendly locals. Lots of places to eat and drink around town. Traffic isn't always great, but the people are laid back. Lawrence has a really cool liberal population"
Lawrence is the best place in all of campus and one of the greatest secrets of the midwest.
Lawrence has some of the best and most unique restaurants around. There is always something new to try and different to eat when you're tired of the same thing.
"I never had any major technological issues. My main gripe would be the high cost of printing, when we already pay high student fees. I feel like it should be free."
"It depends what you want, if you're picky, your price range, and how many people you want to live with. There's something for everyone, its just sometimes harder or easier to find depending on those factors."
"It is a close knit and authentic community of students and professors. Everyone becomes friends and relies on each other to get to the finish. Professors enjoy social activities with students but maintain professionalism. There are many unique speakers, trips, and internship opportunities."
"I did not get in to my first choice academic school, but the second one I applied to happened to be the best and perfect place for me."
Most people have cars or can get rides with friends. The buses are popular and accessible but cars are the top.
"Sports--especially mens basketball--is not just an event, but a way of life. Classes are cancelled for important games, tears are shed for losses, and tattoos are given for championships."
"Greek life is important, but it's not necessary to join to have a social-life"
I think the strictness is fair
KU basketball is an integral part of student life. KU wouldn't be the same without it
There are lots of labs and every library has computers and printers
Lots of international students and students of various backgrounds
"I haven't looked into it too much, but the students I've talked to say that it is accessible and affordable"
They require incoming students to complete an informational session about dugs and alcohol
I wouldn't be going here if it weren't for the scholarships that are available
"There are plenty of options for college students that aren't too far from campus, and many of them deliver"
Snow and ice are difficult on a hilly campus
KU basketball is widely popular. We have had one of the best programs in the nation for quite some time. We won the national championship for women's track last year as well.
"There are plenty of opportunists for research, internships, and other types of experiences in the biological field."
"I am pre-med, so I can imagine there will not be a shortage of jobs."
"Plenty of things to choose from for a wide variety of preferences. Well-known for things like engineering, film, journalism, etc."
"Lots of fraternities and sororities, which means lots of parties, but also a lot of people who view Greeks negatively."
Plenty of computer labs and libraries to visit. Plus there is great wi-fi in nearly every building on campus.
"Bus routes make it easy to get around campus, especially in poor weather."
Often misdiagnosed and are not easy to deal with.
There are plenty of places to live and many of them tailor to college students' needs when it comes to cost of living and transportation.
"Plenty of places to do things like bars, movie theaters, a venue for all types of concerts, and shopping."
Mostly it is parking that is unnecessarily strict. They are not forgiving for new students learning the ropes of where not to park.
"A lot of chain restaurants, but there are many unique places as well. Tons of restaurants in close proximity to campus."
I have seen people get written up for drug usage in the dorms.
Good but bring your own computer
It is abundant but under control
Athletics are really important at KU
You can basically do whatever
Lawrence is a great place
There are many scholarships offered
there are many times that the buses come
There are many places to live when off campus
The reason I came here was because it wasn't some overbearing huge city. It has enough things to be considered a city but the atmosphere of a small town.
My roommate broke her foot and went to the student health center where they told her it was just sprained. Thankfully I still took her to the actually hospital later so she could get a boot and crutches because it was broken and not sprained.
Admission was pretty simple if you're in the top 10% of your graduating class.
The History department brings in a lot of speakers and a lot of them are actually pretty interesting.
The buses provided by KU take you all over Lawrence and it's all free and under your regular student fees. So use the busses. They are a great way to not waste your own gas and get around town easily.
I've never had Chipotle or Noodles and Company till I came here. Now they are the only places I eat.
History department is pretty awesome. Take anything and everything offered by Adrian Lewis. Learned so much from him.
It's literally the worst thing I've ever had to deal with. I got a scholarship but it was never applied to my current semester but instead to a previous one. Therefore I never actually got the $3k. Just worst ever.
"Every semester you get $8 for free printing on campus. I've never used it all, but then again I have my own printer. But it's extremely useful if you forgot to print an essay before you left home. And they have these scanners that are literally a life saver. I use them more than I do the printers probably."
"I'm only here during the fall and the spring so I only see the beautiful sunny weather. The only kick is the snow, but believe me that ain't gonna stop class. They will have that stuff plowed by 6am so you can still go to class."
"There is a large level of diversity. With the numerous major choices and the large number of international students, there are a lot of people to meet."
I have had to walk a mile across campus at 11 o'clock at night before and never felt that I was in any danger.
"One of the best parts about Lawrence is it's ENORMOUS selection of places to eat. Where you need a quick slice of pizza, an elegant dinner for two, or a great sports bar, there are a ton of options."
"Although I have not had one, I have heard a lot about opportunities in my major for internships. All of which have been very well paid."
"If I could do it all again, I would have picked this major right off the bat rather than coming in as an undecided engineer."
"There is free wi-fi access pretty much everywhere on-campus. As an Engineering student, there are computer labs set aside specifically for us, so if I don't have my laptop or it died, I can easily get access to a computer if I need to."
"Just as long as you don't act like a complete idiot, you shouldn't have any problems with breaking rules."
"There is definitely a noticeable party atmosphere around campus, but it tends to taper off some as classes progress and people get more involved in their studies."
"Lawrence is a great place with a cool, laid-back kind of feel practically wherever you go."
"Mostly upper class white catholic students but there is still a variety on campus. If you want diversity, don't join the Greek system."
"It's pretty reliable for the most part, but it's so much nicer having a car on campus."
"The housing staff is ridiculously strict, the building is disgusting and the rooms are tiny. It's nice because the Oliver dorm is so awful that we all bond and probably have the best social atmosphere out of all of the dorms. Since our rooms are so small we all hang out together and go fun places. It's worth all of the bull that we have to put up with."
"The school of psychology has a very easy admission process. Not a lot of requirements, very basic."
It's just your average program
"It's pretty safe at KU, you can walk home alone and not have to worry about anything bad happening. But if you're in a frat or someone's apartment and can't leave, you're trapped."
"Beautiful campus, everyone is pretty friendly. Parking is probably the only downside."
"There is always something going on whether it's a house party, a giant frat party, a smaller frat party, bars, or clubs. There are always a lot of bars to choose from and the drink prices are pretty cheap. The strip clubs in Lawrence are pretty fun too."
"Professors are generally pretty chill, classes are easy. It'd be nice to be challenged once in a while, but I guess that's what the honors college is for."
It's very unpredictable and student housing doesn't take care of the parking lots or sidewalks when it snows. It's awful.
"Greeks are extremely cliquey with others in the Greek community. Non-greek girls and Greek girls generally get along well, but the same cannot be said for the guys."
There are so many good places on Mass Street
Lots of snow this year - glad I didn't go farther north.
Two new dorms are under construction.
Tech support has been very helpful
"Excellent program, professors and fellow students. The SELF program is fantastic."
Excellent major - changed to 4 year program this year.
Lawrence is a great college town
"Buses are great, a bit crowded but always an option"
"I am very happy with my major, its a challenge and I am supported well"
The engineering school is very helpful with providing tutoring to those who need it
"McCullom is quite dirty, old, and run down"
"Greek life is present but not a big deal, nothing bad"
I have always felt safe on campus walking around.
"Its available, but it can be difficult to find an opening"
I can get online wherever and whenever I need to
Good scenery and friendly locals. Great busing system
"It is ok, but it is inconvienent to leave campus, the on campus dining is good enough"
"There is lots of diversity on campus, lots of international students"
Students are supportive of athletics and have great school spirit.
"I don't use them much, but when I have, they are easy to get to and use."
"There is a lot of housing available if you apply early. The cost is very high, $500 or more for a 1 bedroom, parking is usually a problem. Landlords range from horrible to pretty good. I hear horror stories about landlords not fixing things or cleaning up before a new tenant moves in, etc."
There is no shortage of things to do and places to go & there is always someone ready to go out.
It is cold and it's a long way to walk to class...usually up a hill.
"You may see students using drugs & alcohol at apartment complexes, bars and houses, but not so much on campus. The tickets are expensive and campus police monitor parties pretty tight. The Greek houses seem to have more use on campus then most other groups."
The worst is the parking tickets. It's almost like the campus police wait and watch so they can ticket you.
"The FAFSA is way too long...I did not apply for aid because my parents ""make too much money"" for me to get any aid except for UNsubsidized student loans. The people in the financial aid office seem to think that everyone knows what's going on and we don't. We need explanations, pointers and ideas."
There don't seem to be very many problems so I think they must be doing their job pretty well. I feel safe on campus and haven't had any issues at all. There is a really good presentation given at orientation that I think helps.
"You know what's awesome? Being told ""you don't have to come to class--I don't take attendance in my classes--but by missing, you might not end up being able to take tests and quizzes and stuff, which probably means you'll get a good grade.""

KU respects most of its students as adults; instead of punishing them for minor infractions, it simply lets them reap the rewards of their actions. Fail to attend? You've screwed yourself. Break the parking rules? Eh, if you're caught, you're going to get the same kind of fine you'd get anywhere else."
"I wouldn't know. Their houses look super fancy, but I personally don't care enough about chapters to get in one."
"KU is one of, if not the most liberal school in the Midwest, to the point where it's ahead of most schools in terms of diversity. If you can think of it, it's probably here, and there's a sincere desire from the school to actively support and celebrate diversity as much as possible."
Where do I even begin? Lawrence is known for being a big party town--and with good reason. The sheer variety of stuff to do pretty much always means something's going on.
"It honestly doesn't feel like they're going above and beyond to help you get what you need. At least they make sure you get your school money before school starts, rather than later, unlike the school I transferred from."
"As a foodie, I value my off-campus cuisine, which is why I absolutely love Lawrence. They have EVERYTHING, and it's almost all good. My only complaint--my ONLY complaint--is that Tryyaki once gave me reheated fried rice late at night. Not cool."
"Honestly, I don't see much drug use going on. I think the teachers mention smoking pot more than the students, which still isn't all that often."
"My main complaint about the bus is that it tends to arrive either 30-40 minutes early or 5-10 minutes late. This can be great, if you're wanting to leave class--wait 15 minutes, ride home. But honestly, showing up to the bus stop and having the guy drive away just as you're walking up to the bus on a day when the temp is below freezing? Not cool."
"I honestly have never felt unsafe on campus; my time in the medical center made it seem alright, but it's in an awkward location in relation to all the other buildings."
"I'm really liking the school so far. The workload's pretty decent, the professors are easy to get a hold of, the TAs really seem to know their stuff. It's great."
The wind tends to always be blowing thirty miles an hour in the direction you're walking.
It's great it's easy it's fun.
This is a great school for Pharmacy and the program is awesome and there are always people there to answer any questions you have.
The bus system isn't bad except for in bad weather or when people decide to attend class. The buses stop for longer periods at some residence halls so that by the time they reach other halls they are full. On any given morning three full buses might pass you up before you get one. You have to get there pretty early to make it to your class on time.
its hard to find scholarships and i couldnt get many loans
KU Mens Basketball games have to be the best experience
we have a great academic program
only on weekends does it get bad
"when its cold, walking sucks or when its super hot"
"a very old building, needs to be renovated"
In my experience so far the academia at KU is great with plenty of teachers who really want what is best for their students.
There are plenty of undergraduate options at KU and they have a great career services center that helps students get started in careers.
Off campus housing is good with a few different options for apartment living but most are far to pricey for college students.
The local atmosphere of Lawrence is great and would absolutely love to live here after I graduate.
Campus dining is slightly above average but nothing to go crazy over plenty of spots to eat but most offer the same things.
"If you don't about KU's basketball team I don't know why you are reading this but, Allen Fieldhouse is the best arena in college basketball and a cathedral to the sport."
I do not drive on campus but I know that permits are far to expensive and parking is an absolute joke but that is right on par for every college I've been to.
"KU has a very good nightlife with plenty of parties and some great bars that are fun and cheap, only downside is not many options."
It's Kansas so expect a ton of windy days. Cold winters and hot summers.
The bus system at at KU is excellent and can get you pretty much anywhere around town.
I absolutely love this school and wanted to go here ever since I was little but the only think keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the complete unwillingness to grant out of state students in state tuition or at the very least lower the rates and add more scholarships.
Being known for their medical school it is no surprise that KU prides itself on their great Health and Safety.
"There is a lot of drug and alcohol use at KU, but I don't think peer pressure to drink or use is a problem."
Speaking from personal experience I think there are far to little scholarships available to students especially out of state students.
"The aesthetics on the KU campus are fantastic with plenty of great student facilities like Ambler Rec. and Anschutz Library with the best backdrop in america, Allen Fieldhouse."
I absolutely love the buildings at the KU campus it has some nice older buildings with lots of charm but also features many new and future state of the art buildings.
"I don't have much experience with Greek Life at KU but I have never had any run ins with any of the Frats, that being said there is a general jealous feeling from some towards the frats and sororities."
In my experience with KU housing which is not traditional because I lived in the Jayhawk Towers which are much larger than traditional dorms and great but I have heard rough stories about the resident halls but cannot speak from experience.
There are plenty of great off campus restaurants my personal favorite for best food is Jefferson's while if you are more interested in atmosphere I would suggest The Burger Stand.
There are many different minorities at the University of Kansas but the amount of minorities is still a very small percentage compared to the amount of white Americans on campus.
One has access to a clinic but the quality is questionable.
We get occasial snow days but at most 2-6 days of snow days.
"There is a lot of Greek life, but it is to the point that it isn't even special to be in one anymore. You are just fine if you are not in one."
I have never had a problem with the campus security so I have nothing to say. I have heard many different things though from other students.
I have only been around Engineers and guys at the gym which are two total opposites so I cannot really say.
A lot of fast food restaurants to choose from. But that's about it.
The housing is very poor in terms of building quality. The staff is nice which makes up for the buildings but they could still use some renovations.
"I have heard that a lot of people have a pplied for it, but I haven't heard anything bad from it so far."
The fan support for the KU basketball team is fenominal.
"The transportation options are great, especially in the evenings."
The specific majors are very supportive in the engineering department since there are so few students.
There are a lot of varying majors to choose from but none of them are that special other than the pharmacy major.
"The computers available at the computer labs aren't the best, but they aren't bad either. The Engineering department could use some new computers, though."
The college community here is great. There are a lot of great people on campus who can help you out and a lot of activities to do that don't involve illegal activities.
"You hear about drugs and alcohol being used at college parties, but if you don't want to partake in these activities it is easy to ignore them."
"As an out of state student, I would think there were be more options. They provide a website with a list of scholarships."
"Can be unpredictable but generally pretty nice. Sunny, warm"
I think this campus is extremely diverse and overall a very accepting place.
I sometimes use the bus system. I think it's fairly easy if you figure out the times
"I was once Greek, it was a great experience for the few years I was a member, but it wasn't the fitting lifestyle for me. I still talk to the women in the house and they love their renovations for the new house."
"When it snows it's awful,, there are a lot if hills! But any other day the campus is beautiful."
There are always police out on Thursday- Saturday nights carding kids walking by and giving them breathalyzer tests.
"I know that the city of Lawrence is very strict on underage drinking and drug use, which is awesome!"
"I only live three hours from home, so driving back is always an option for me."
There are so many apartment complexes weaved into campus. It would be difficult not to find a place!
I always see KU campus police. There are patrolling the majority of the time.
"The process of getting into my program was very difficult. I was required to take a standardized test to rank me, along with an interview and many other difficult tasks."
The lengthy process was miserable. My one tip would be to get your FAFSA in on time.
"The workload is very difficult, as well as the curriculum. The facilities are perfect for studying. There are many small rooms specifically for studying."
"The majority of the professors have been practicing pharmacists so that's really inspiring. The process of applying for the School of Pharmacy was difficult which included answering essay questions, sending in letters of recommendation, PCAT test scores sent in, & an interview."
Allen Fieldhouse is known as the LOUDEST arena in the US. it's absolutely beautiful inside.
The school itself has so much pride! I'm currently in the School of Pharmacy & have learned so much!
"There is a variety of people that attend the university of Kansas and no one is afraid to show their own style. At the same time, everyone is very respectful and I have not encountered anyone being a victim of bullying. Everyone is really cool and accepting. Everyone I have met has shown passion for what they do."
"Campus crime is very slim, like any other college there can be a couple of incidents but overall security around campus is very efficient and safety services are usually very reliable. I feel relatively safe walking alone during the day, but at night it is always a must to walk with someone specially being a girl and campus being so big. There are not many lights throughout campus which makes it a little scary, but if walking with someone, you can feel very safe."
Everyone is so nice and respectful. Staff is always willing to help.
Every building is very well conserved and they are beautiful. Campus is absolutely incredible.
Best experience ive ever had has been in allen field house
Safety on campus is great nothing bad ever goes down
Variety of great food for greek to italian to mexican and so on
All use apple or microsoft the best brands out
It fills up sometimes but usually lots of spots
Some of the best I've seen and I've attended three colleges
Libraries are awesome here some of the best
You could explain it in one word headache
"Of course i would i love it here, basketball is crazy supported here and its one of my favorite sports"
I've never attended another college with a better atmosphere then KU
There is people from all over the world that come to Ku
Safe ride is clutch if your intoxicated and you need to get to your apartment without making a bad decision and if your a KU student they will take you back for free.
The bar/club scene is the best i've experienced anywhere!!
"I love kansas weather you get to experience it all snow, rain, heat it is perfect"
"housing is great close proximity to campus, dorms are ok to small for my taste so i moved to a apartment and am loving it"
Really strict about drinking in dorms. Lots of write ups
I love the weather. It's pretty mild and fall is absolutely beautiful!
I really like dining off-campus. Lots of variety and really good food.
Don't have my car at school yet
Drugs & alcohol are readily available
"Love KU, wouldn't want to be anywhere else"
Lots of buses. Sometimes unreliable
Lots of good opportunities to be taken
Workload is intense and challenging
"Fun town, less so if you're underage"
Great places to hang out (i.e. the union and dorms are always hosting activities)
Campus life is vibrant and engaging
Love KU basketball and intramurals
Food is good. Healthy options
"The diversity of the campus is average, like every other college town has to offer. There's something for everyone though!"
The campus dining halls are great and they all newly renovated! The variety differs from hall to hall but each hall has a great amount of vegan/vegetarian options.
The University has a very helpful staff that helps you with the financial aid process.
Even KU doesn't have a ranked football team the tailgating more than enough fun to make up for it. Basketball on the other hand is something that we are known nationally for and that experience itself makes campus that much better!
"There plenty of computer available on campus, mac or pc! Especially with the amount of libraries KU has to offer there is always a computer available to use. KU has a great feature that you're allowed up to $8.00 of free printing on campus, and that goes a long way."
The main campus road is becoming better lit
The main issue is parking tickets
Students want to have fun while going to school
The libraries are resourceful and helpful
The facilities are incredibly historical
"Many different options, and they're all fun"
The tradition at KU can't be matched anywhere else
"Off-Campus Housing is nice, but too far away"
On campus the transportation is great and somewhat off campus but if you want to go any where after five or on the weekends a car is needed if it isn't within walking distance.
"The only time I don't feel safe on campus is walking around campus at night on my own, but if I need I know I can always call Safe Ride."
The college atmosphere and local atmosphere is great! I love it!
"Its chilly, but I wanted that drastic change. If you love snow and layers you've come to the right place."
There's always a bus available. 6am-5pm Monday-Saturday 7pm-4am everynight except Sunday
I never lived outside of the dorms so I couldnt tell you how great/bad it is to live off campus
"If you're looking for a fun night go to a Frat party. If you want a relationship stay away from the Frats, but I promise you there are a ton of good looking smart guys who are boyfriend material."
"If you leave the dorms early enough, getting a parking spot for class isnt so bad. They offer buses every day except Sunday from 6am till 5pm"
I love the dorms. I wish I could do it all 4 years!
There were enough choices in scholarships but you better keep your GPA up the entire time you're in school!
Buffalo Wild Wings and Hot Box Cookies. Enough said.
Its average...It'll fill you up. Best night is definitely taco night!
I loved it! It was something different from sunny South Florida. The people were ridiculously nice and the teachers were an incredible help. Definitely worth every penny college could suck out of you (parents).
BASKETBALL GAMES!!!! ALL THE WAY! Great memories on Mass street and just living an ideal college life.
"Fantastic teachers, TA's, and outside of class help."
There's a lot of stress with papers and assignments but hey that's college!
There are quite a lot of Frats that distribute excessive amounts of alcohol during parties. I see people coming into the dorms or just walking around campus drunk more than I ever expected.
"I will be part of an internship, only because it is required for degree."
"I totally repeat the experience, it is challenge and enticing."
It teaches and provide many opportunities to prepare for the near or far future.
The program is going well and interesting to partake in.
Have there own way of interacting with other students.
"Many opportunities, but I feel there is not enough for the campus population."
"Plenty of opportunities, but hours of dedication is outrageous."
I enjoy the academic opportunities connected to my major.
I enjoy the availability to professors help and advice.
"Plenty of places to go to, but most prices are higher than expected."
Most are easy-going towards most minority that exist on campus.
I have no personal experience with this area of activity.
"During daytime hours they are relatively more involved with nearby city, night time include us."
"I have seen many opportunities to live off-campus, but very uneducated about the topic."
"It is easy to ride, but some rides are longer than others; especially as it get colder."
"Plenty of things to do off campus, ease of access to off campus too."
"Most peers are easy to get along with, but there are some who are a challenge."
I personally do not eat at campus dining regularly.
"I have no permanent residence on campus, these are peer opinions."
"Computers are usually available, but depends on time of day."
Enjoyable experience in campus. I personally favor the opportunities on campus.
"Decent defense road-wise, but could use more along pathway walking on campus."
"Weather is all over the place, but the communication of temperature is easy to find."
"Ease of access to alcohol, unknown about any other drugs available. Has not effected the students in class."
"I can personally always find spots to park, except game days. Also distant from classes is pretty good."
"It decent not actually living on campus, but attending is good."
Large area for classes to attended. Very flexible and easy access to scholarships.
So far its been great.
Depends on your personal experience with greeks. Im actually friends with a few.
Its all great and beneficial.
Living on campus is fun. Differs from hall to hall and the RAs can contribute to how much you like it.
The majors offered are pretty diverse and fairly challenging.
You can literally get into something every night.
Safe bus/ride is very reliable.
You can fit in wherever.
You can always find somebody to have fun with.
You can always find something to do.
The computers are good and reliable.
"KU sports is the main reason I chose to go to school there, and it hasn't disappointed. Almost all students are huge fans of the athletics and actively support them by attending the games."
"The night life has many options, and the bars have good deals to get large amounts of people to show up."
"Although I have has terrible experiences with the health services, I do always feel pretty safe on campus."
"Many people participate in drugs, yet to those who don't want to participate it can easily go unnoticed."
"The greek life seems to be a big deal to those who are in it. Most students who aren't involved, like myself, think it is a waste of time and money."
"The computer labs are average, but the network is very good and easy to connect to from a personal computer."
Getting into the biology program is not very complicated. The student basically has to have above a 2.5 GPA then sign a piece of paper.
"I love KU. It is a good mix of challenging work, diversity, and a fun college atmosphere."
"There are lots of different majors offered at the school, many of which are ranked highly in the nation."
"The school work is challenging. Unfortunately you often run across professors that don't care about their students, but when you do get a good professor interested in your success then the class can be very fun."
There are always different speakers or events on campus to attend
The buildings are always kept clean and updated.
It is the perfect college town in my opinion. There is always different events going on that appeal to many different people.
I have never had too bad of an experience but it could always go more smooth. KU rarely offers any scholarships whatsoever.
There are a lot of options or different places to go with reasonable prices
Rooms are very small. Hot water was in showers were poor.
"The police in Lawrence hand out parking tickets like free candy. The RAs in the dorms are strict about drug and alcohol use if they see them, but they don't go out of their way to find students using them. The police are rather strict about house party noise complaints."
The KU journalism program is one of the top 10 in the nation. I'm glad to be a part of the j-school where students collaborate but push each other to do better. I wish our broadcast program was more robust.
KU is ranked in many programs. The professors are very helpful and students can access tutors and study options that are good for them.
"Though the bars and clubs are good and there is a variety, I wish there were other nightlife options."
"While the university provides plenty of computers, it's much easier to have your own. This allows you to work any time anywhere rather than having to go to the lab. Students can access computers in dorms, Greek houses and many campus buildings. As a journalism student, I wish the university provided free editing software."
Guys at KU tend to look for hookups rather than relationships. They tend to look for drunk girls at parties to sleep with rather than talking to girls in their classes or activities. I'm dating a guy from Kansas State.
"Kansas provides a great ACT scholarship that I received when I applied to the university. However, I wish that KU had its own database of all the available scholarships that students can apply for."
"Lawrence is the quintessential college town. There are constantly bands playing and activities for students. It is also close to Kansas City, so students can make day trips if they have a car. Kansas State University is only an hour away, and many students have friends that go to Kansas State University."
The weather in campus frequently changes suddenly. The winds can make walking to campus difficult.
"We invented basketball. Basketball is huge and football is improving. However, club sports are not promoted enough."
"The dorms are clean and promote social interaction. However, the rooms do not provide enough storage space."
"The bus service to get around the city is convenient, but the bus and train stations are not particularly convenient to campus. The airport is almost an hour away."
"Greek life encourages social interaction and involvement. However, it can also encourage partying, though there isn't considerable pressure. The female rush process is stressful and should be revised."
"Though alcohol isn't allowed in the dorms, it is easy to sneak past the RA's. Students do drugs in the dorms and some show up to class high. Very few are caught. Undercover police come to bars and give out MIP charges, but this deters few people."
As long as you aren't being stupid you will be fine. If you flaunt things you will get caught and get in trouble.
I received a good about of money from the school but it is very hard to keep your scholarships especially in a hard major which I am in.
"I personally joined a fraternity and I love it. It was one of the best decisions I have made. Greek life is not huge but it definitely has a presence. It is also more than just parties, we have raised thousands for charity and do a lot for both the community and the school."
There are computers available for students everywhere. There is also wireless access pretty much everywhere on campus and it is fairly reliable.
"Lawrence, Kansas is a great town. The locals love the college and vice versa. Kansas City is pretty close which means access to a big city and the sports etc. that come with it."
The winter is cold and the summer is hot but in between it is really nice. The weather can be irregular but its not awful.
Parking can be difficult to find and officials are pretty strict about permit parking but free parking is quite common and in good locations.
KU Basketball is one of the best known programs in the nation and the students come out in full force to support them. On game day the school spirit is ridiculous.
Mass. Street is full of restaurants and many of them offer student discounts. It is a bit far if you are a freshman at the dorms but there is a wide variety there and a lot of fun.
Being a Jayhawk is like nothing else. None of my friends at other schools get the same amount of school spirit and pride that comes with being a Jayhawk
The buses are all free and run pretty late then there is SafeBus that runs all weekend starting Thursday and goes till three in the morning. There is also SafeRide which runs all week and will give students rides late at night.
There is nothing like watching a game in Allen Fieldhouse. The tradition and the students make it an amazing experience.
There are plenty of places to go to hangout and the libraries are always a great place to go to study.
I definitely feel safe on campus but there are always those stupid people who try to start trouble when out on the town and its hard to prevent that.
KU is known for its basketball program and we recently drafted the number 1 pick: Andrew Wiggins
Lawrence is a chill college town.
It's been a mostly positive experience.
Buses are nice to have to get around campus.
KU is renowned for Study Abroad.
Great libraries and free rec center for students.
I hate the KAP program. The rest is great.
I'm happy with the English department.
They are liberal in the right ways.
There are attractive guys. I don't focus on that for I already have a boyfriend.
It gets old after awhile.
Mass Street is the place to go for variety & cost.
KU has their own police department. They are fast.
Lawrence transportation is pretty good for not being a big city. I also have a car so if I need to go somewhere off campus I will just drive. When I need to go somewhere on campus I take the bus.
There is a lot of diversity. I've seen life through many different point of views because of that. I've had the privilege to meet many international students and learn about their backgrounds and heritages.
"The social scene is great, the campus life is great, the facilities are pretty average, and academic programs are good."
"The libraries are great! Watson Library is my favorite place to study, the atmosphere helps me to get my work done efficiently. Campus traditions are awesome here, it's one of the best parts. I get goose bumps every time I watch the pre-game basketball video in Allen Field house. KU is a basketball powerhouse, so the traditions associated with that are absolutely awesome."
"There are so many different kinds of people here, to many to generalize. The mainstream kind of girls are very preppy but are also very nice."
"As a Greek, I am totally biased. Being Greek has been a great thing for me! It has helped me make friends, network, get involved on campus, learn professionalism, and all together become a more well rounded person. On average, Greeks have a high GPA than non-Greeks which has to prove something. Greeks love being part of the Greek community and see the positive sides which is hard for GDI's to see. GDI's general perception of Greeks is snobby and only good for partying which is not true. I know nice, respectable men and women from the Greek community that will being doing something worth while in their lives. It's a great thing to become a part of, I would strongly recommend it."
They are strict about things involving the safety of the majority of people.
I'm only in my fall semester of my freshman year but it really sucks.. I'm taking upper level Biology and Chemistry and its very challenging. Those courses take a lot of outside work to do well. I would be very pleased with B's in these courses.
"The professors are alright. It's fairly obvious that they aren't here to teach, they are here for research."
"I got a $4,000 scholarship over 4 years for my ACT score but I will likely loose my scholarship after the spring semester due to my GPA. To keep the scholarship you must maintain an average GPA of 3.4 which is difficult one you get into higher level or more rigorous courses."
"Most of the time there are decent food options but being a picky eater makes it a little more difficult to put a variety in my eating habits. I often eat the same things over and over which gets old. I have a few favorite meals but other than that, everything is just okay."
I have not lived off campus but I know many people that are currently or have in the past.
I've had a great experience so far. I'm not fond of my classes but I do what I need to do to be successful. I currently live in an on campus dorm which has led to me meeting my best friends. Living in the dorms has by far been the greatest experience of college. I've met so many people and I absolutely love living here. I also joined the Greek community this fall and I love being a part of that. I have found a good balance between my studies and my social life. Finding something to get involved in on campus has made me more of a well rounded student and has helped me to keep my sanity with my difficult course load.
"This university is known for being a party school, with that comes alcohol and drugs. Many students partake and also many students choose not to. It's completely up to you to decide what you want to do. Peer pressure isn't a big thing here, most people will respect whatever decision you choose to make about drugs and alcohol."
A computer is a necessity. Almost all homework is online and there are few places with computer labs. Printing is expensive so only print if necessary. The wifi is slow but there isn't any other options so you get used to it.
Lawrence is a great college town. There is a large variety of places to eat on Mass. St. which is close to the northeast side of campus. There are also many delivery options that will deliver to the University dorms. There are great restaurants all over down but the ones on Mass. St. are the most easily accessible without a car.
"It's Kansas weather...for those who don't know, temperature changes throughout the day are very common in the fall and spring. Weather in the fall in spring is very unpredictable. In the summer it's very hot and humid, that usually starts in June and lasts through mid September. As for winter, it's different every year; Kansas winter can happen anywhere between October and April. Some winters are bitter cold, some aren't, and some go back and forth between bitter cold and mildly cold."
It's a college town with lots to do.
I don't see it at all.
Ku basketball is very important in school life.
"I don' t know that much about it, but there are hundreds of students who are a part of Greek life so they seem to have a good time."
I'm having a very difficult time finding the proper financial aid to pay for schooling and I don' t want this to be the reason why I can't reach my goals.
"We have one of the best college basketball programs in the country, a national champion track and field team, and a outstanding volleyball team. Our school is very supportive of athletics. We always seem to get the top basketball recruits year after year."
"The parking permits are a reasonable price compared to other colleges across the country but it's very difficult to find parking because so many students have cars. Going around campus, one doesn't need a car really at all, but for a drive around the city is understandable."
I love all the opportunities I have when it comes to my environmental studies major. The workload I have for the classes dealing with my major are very substantial and I learn alot of meaningful material. I have gotten many intership requests and research opportunities to take advantage of.
"I think most of the professors teach the material very well with some good, but challenging material that really works our brains. It's kind of simple to register for classes for the upcoming semester. We have numerous libraries across campus to accomodate all the studious student body."
"Honestly I don't see that much but I know people who like to do those drugs but for the most part nobody tries to pressure me into doing anything I don't want to. The alcohol/drug enforcement is very poor because even though you aren't allowed to bring it in the dorms, there have been a number of people who have snuck it in."
Usually the weather tends to change alot because living in Kansas that's kind of what you have to expect. So it doesn't really affect me that much since I'm accustomed to this weather already.
"I like living on campus because it's convient with my classes since I don't have a car and also I get to make new friends, such as my roommate who is a wonderful person. The dorm I live in is not overall too satifying but I can deal with it. I really like how social everyone on my floor is and that makes the flow of making friends alot easier. The cost is pretty affordable compared to the other dorms on campus and it's close to most of my classes, the rec center, and the basketball arena so that's very convient."
"Campus life is the best here on KU... for those who want to lead a healthy, there's a rec center that's opened every day of the week. Libraries that are opened 24hrs a day to help students study. Being in the dorms is like having your own family here on campus that supports you emotionally and academically"
There are a lot of unique things about my school... there is one of the best study abroad programs... great resource to help study and a lot of resources to claim a place in the global world
fun and friendly campus to be in
there's always a computer available to work on in the libraries and at the dorms. Printing is free at the dorm and it only costs 8 cents
The weather today is nice.. it's neither too cold nor hot.. just the perfect weather to be out for a football game.
"There are so many Off-Campus Housing options! Most of them are very close to campus, and if not they are easily accessible by transportation. Many of them are very nice and cost efficient. A lot of them are in a safe neighborhood and have easy parking."
"A lot of the students are very nice and considerate. There are a few that seem stuck up, but that is to be expected. There are a variety of looks at KU."
There isn't a lot of visibility at KU. Although most kids participate in drinking it is not something that people feel pressured to do.
"I am not personally into the Greek Life, but for the most part I think it's something that's very big on campus. There are a ton of different housing options, and it all seems very organized."
"The printing is very easy to use and for the most part is free. The wireless network usually works really well, but is a little slow at times."
"The school as a whole tries to involve every single student in many of the activities. Everyone is very bright and helpful. They know a lot about the school, and how to get people involved."
There are so many events that students can attend. There really is a group for every single student to fit into. I feel very comfortable in talking to other students and staff and know I will get an appropriate response.
KU IS HONESTLY THE BEST!!! I can't see myself anywhere else!
Coming from MN the winters aren't as cold... But summer on the other hand is HOT
"KU basketball is one of the best in the country, but then again basketball was invented here! The atmosphere at the games is the best!"
"If that is something you like to do, there are may options."
There are many places for students to hang out and plans are constantly be changed to benefit students.
There are many different opportunities available. Most students can find some organization where they fit in.
It doesn't seem like the university has very strict policies at times.
The school is very expensive. For the most part the only financial aid one can get is loans.
There are a variety of different things to do in town. It is very focused on college students.
Campus is very diverse. There are many different cultures on campus and they blend together fairly well.
"There is a variety of food options, but it is all really expensive."
There is lots of Greek life available and they seemed to be involved in a lot of campus organizations.
"There is lots of alcohol use, and it doesn't seem to be super enforced. At other times, it is really enforced."
"There are not many places to park on main campus, but there are quite a few lots. Finding a spot during the day is difficult though."
"There are many labs available, but the computers are usually slow and have a lot of things downloaded on them. Students are given some free printing, but it would be helpful if there was more given."
"I feel relatively safe on campus, but do not walk alone at night."
The weather is always changing throughout the day so it is sometimes difficult to decide on what to wear in the morning.
The bus system on the University is great. It allows transportation to all parts of town.
"The food at Mrs. E's is good, and on campus there are a wide range of food options. The downside is that the food on campus is extremely costly."
"The off-campus housing is either costly and extremely nice, or moderately priced but trashy."
"I absolutely love KU. The people are friendly, and those who pull the high school drama are usually the ones who drop out."
"The walk to class is a pain, and the cost of the dorms is ridiculous. The meal plan is only used sparingly unless you live in Lewis."
"The exercise facilities are very clean, and packed full of different exercise options."
"It's Kansas weather, what would you expect? One day it's 100 degrees then it's 10 degrees."
"Sometimes the work load for b.s. classes is a bit much, but I think classes are relatively easy."
"The professors are all extremely helpful, but the TA's are a little hit and miss."
"The atmosphere is a vibrant college town, but it is not overwhelming. Everyone is accepting of students, and the shopping is varied. There is a lot of interaction between KU and Haskell."
"If you are under 18, you might as well get a fake ID or borrow a 21 and up ID from someone because none of the clubs will allow 18 -20. There are one or two nights a semester where there are 18 and up nights at the Cave."
"There is a very diverse population at KU, and there is always a place for someone to fit in. Most people dress in leggings and a nice shirt. Girls and guys are both attractive and nice."
"The traditions run within each students blood and walking on campus gives everyone chills. Basketball games are undeniable the most tradition based sport we have, and activities on campus are numerous. There is always something going on. There are always clubs to join and places to study."
"Our building are very clean, there are lots of vending/ food options, and there is always something going on at Wescoe or the Union."
"The only down side to Lawrence is finding a way to get to KC for a flight, train, or bus ride."
"While in your dorm, Resnet is used, and it is the biggest pain to set up and get working. While on campus, everyone is on the Jayhawk network, but it constantly drops off."
"There are various sororities and fraternities, and it is a huge part of KU. Everywhere you look on campus, there are 10 or more kids in a sorority or frat."
"There are hardly any places to park on campus near classes or building for free. At Daisy Hill, a year long parking pass costs over $100, and there are very few parking spots at Templin."
"There is a wide variety of ethnic and cultural cuisine, but many of them are pricy."
"There is a lot of drug use, but they are trying to crack down on it in the dorms."
"Some paths are unlit, and it is a little sketchy to walk alone later in the day. There are a lot of non-students on campus."
"We are accepting of everyone on campus, and there is always someone to talk to."
They sound more strict about things than they actually are.
"Wow where to even begin. KU has an amazing variety of dining on campus, located at every corner and almost every building! There are 5 dining halls for residence of the dorms, and varies other food courts find all over campus. From Pizza Hut to sushi, all is found on campus. The libraries have coffee shops which are open every day during great hours. My personal favorite has to be ""The Garden"" located inside the Kansas Union. Its a food court with so many different variety's to choose from one couldn't possibly try it all even if they went there everyday for a month! The prices are always reasonable and never ask too much, they accept all types of currency including credit/debit cards, cash, and meal plan cards. Overall if you're hungry take a walk on campus and you'll find something to crave your ever desire."
"Campus strictness varies depending on where you live, what classes your'e in, what you're involved in, and how you go about your everyday life. Many classes that are held in lecture based meetings do not take attendance and do not baby you around. Some other classes that are smaller will take attendance and will affect your grade heavily. Dorms are all extremely strict on alcohol and will not tolerate it whatsoever. If caught with alcohol you will be written up and have a meeting with an advisor as to see your punishment. Usually a first offense will deem you community service, a second will be more serious, and a third is chance of expulsion. A student must be smart around here, you're not allowed to walk around with alcohol obviously or else you will get fined by the campus police which seem to be everywhere. Honestly I think its a good think because I feel extremely safe on this campus with the police here. They always keep order and know how to handle things. As for having visitors that is based on your dorms policies, my dorm I'm allowed to have people over as long as we aren't loud and distractive. Its nice lets you be in charge of your room so gives you a sense of maturity and ownership."
"I love my school so much. Its incredible, it's such an honor to be a Jayhawk and something I wear with pride. The traditions here are incredible, from our amazing Alma Mater chant, to the history and creation of the modern sport of basketball, it was all created here. The studies and impact this University has had on our world is beyond me. My favorite experience so far would have to be watching Kansas football beat West Virginia this past weekend. That win snapped a 27-game conference losing streak, the worst in college football. We won in a thrilling game, stormed the field, and with the entire football team and Jayhawk family sang the famous Alma Mater that President Roosevelt fell in love with and named the best in the country. After the song was over we proceeded to tear down the field goal post in celebration, we walked it over to the nearby lake on campus, and like the many before us, followed the tradition and threw the goal post into Potter Lake. It was incredible to see the thousands of people all in this together as one giant family. From young to old all Jayhawks are the same. My only regret is not joining Greek Life earlier. The kids on campus that are involved in Greek Life always seem like they have something to do and are always involved around the University. I would 100% choose this school again, without a doubt in my mind. Im in love with being a Jayhawk."
"The transportation services here at the University of Kansas are greatly designed. They have numerous pick spots all around campus and around Lawrence which is the college town around our campus. For example just in front of my dorm there is a pick up spot for the bus, and in the back of the parking lot there is another bus stop. Its extremely easy to figure out bus schedules and routes. The cost is one of the best parts, its free as long you're on campus and if you're off campus if you have your student I.D. on you its also free. Trains are located in the town of Lawrence and take you all the way downtown. Rideshares, and buses are always readily available if you need a ride to the airport or cities around the greater Kansas area. My only complaint would be buses don't run on sundays and have a limited schedule on saturdays, thats why I couldn't rate it five stars."
"KU has all 4 seasons- Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. The campus's architecture and design allows you to enjoy each season to it's fullest. There are hills for sledding during the winter. The Campus plants beautiful flowers everywhere that bloom in the spring and remind you of the upcoming summer holiday. Fall is my favorite season on campus because the trees burst into beautiful colors that accent the buildings and natural beauty of the campus. The transportation available to students allows us to get to and from activities, class etc. no matter what season we're in."
"Campus police do a great job at policing for parking permits. They ticket if you are parked in an unauthorized spot without the correct permit.
It is fairly easy to create a new student club. You just have to have 2 or more people file a petition. Alcohol and drug use in the dorms is not permitted. There are strict consequences for breaking these rules. KU allows protests and demonstrations to take place on campus. I have learned quite a bit during these demonstrations."
"Kansas City is less than 1 hour away and provides professional baseball, football and soccer teams. There are multiple museums and attractions in both Lawrence and Kansas City. Lawrence and Kansas City hosts multiple art and theater shows. Lawrence has a great music scene and indie film scene on Massachusetts street. Students have opportunities to see various bands and films for cheap affordable prices. Lawrence is proud of the University. There were numerous times when I have been out to eat with a friend and a family would offer to buy our meals because they knew we were students."
"There is such a variety of off campus housing available for students. I have lived in apartments, houses and duplexes. The KU transportation buses pick up at the large majority of living areas which allows students to live off campus even without a vehicle. Living off campus allowed me to have a more peaceful living experience. When I needed quiet for studying, thats what I got. IT was perfect for me."
"I felt the application process was very smooth. I researched the process for application, applied and received notification when the school had made their decision. The school has been great in communicating the process and answering any questions that arose."
My internship has been a positive experience. The University placed me with them and was instrumental in ensuring it was the right fit for both me and the agency. It is a non paid internship that is providing the necessary responsibilities and duties to fulfill my need for my degree.
I loveeee Lawrence's food! It is one of my favorite things! There is such a variety of cuisine and is very affordable.
There are quite a few bars and nightlife for University students. The 'strip' is not conveniently located near campus and would be hard to walk to and from. The campus has a taxi service called Safe Bus where they provide rides to students to discourage drunk driving.
"I did not pledge so my knowledge is minimum about Greek life. My best friend was in a sorority and I did spend a lot of time at her sorority house. The house conditions were good, comparable to those of the dorms. The sorority sisters were very friendly and welcoming to me even though I was a non Greek. I would say it paints an accurate picture of the attitudes on campus. I did not view the Greek's any differently than anyone else. We are all Jayhawk's receiving the same education and proud of our school."
I did not partake in underage drinking or partake in any drug use during my undergrad at KU and still do not partake in drug use as a graduate student. I have never felt peer pressured to participate or left out for not participating. The school does a good job at educating the students about the dangers of underage drinking and drug use and discouraging them from participating. KU enforces strict rules when students are caught in such activity.
"The campus has buses that are free for students to ride all throughout campus. There are a few buses available for off campus activities, but I would say to experience life outside of campus you would need a car. The campus is spread out but has been made very accessible for biking, walking and of course the buses are also available. For long distance transportation, a student would have to get to Kansas City (45 minutes-1 hour) to fly or ride the train."
The tech support and technology available is incredible. There are computer laps in almost every building on campus as well as multiple libraries that offer computers throughout. You can also check out laptops at libraries on campus. Wireless internet is available throughout the campus with the use of your student ID and password. The University provides $8's worth of free printing before charging a small fee for printing on campus.
"The campus is beautiful! There are several locations to comfortably sit and study. The libraries are equipped with state of the art technology and has staff members present to help you work everything. One semester, my computer crashed and the library allowed me to check out a laptop to work on a paper for class.
The traditions that KU has surrounding sports, the Rock Chalk chant and academics are impeccable."
"KU offers an exceptional education and has great traditions that embody their institution. The campus is absolutely beautiful and gives you a sense of pride, knowing you are a part of the beauty. My professors have always made themselves available for any questions, concerns and advice. When I see a Jayhawk, I hear the Rock Chalk Chant and feel a sense of pride that I am a part of such wonderful traditions."
There's a lot to choose from and prices are fairly reasonable.
They definitely make sure there's a variety of options and that vegans/vegetarians and considered.
All the facilities here are pretty great!
"I haven't had many problems with girls on campus, but some of the guys here can be a bit rude."
"You can definitely tell that many students take part in it, but housing definitely makes sure that nothing goes on in the buildings."
There are buses that take you from the dorms to your classes and even to other areas off campus. The only problem s that the on-campus buses stop at 5:30pm and the off-campus ones stop at 7:30pm.
There are soooo many majors to choose from!
The computers are pretty great. There are always ones available for you to use in just about every building and one of the buildings has free printing!
I've had a pretty good experience so far. There's a few things I would change but it has been fairly good overall.
"It's pretty nice on some days. Doesn't get too cold but the wind here is crazy! Make sure you bring a jacket.. If you live in the Midwest it's just about the same as other places here, but the wind makes it a bit colder."
It is kind of hard to get into the classes you want/need since there are so many people at this school and not everyone has the same enrollment date. But the classes do cross over a lot and still count or help toward your major or toward the core curriculum.
There is a lot of work given and tests to be taken but the teachers seem to want to help students succeed.
It was fairly difficult. I had to talk to multiple people and set up many appointments to get financial aid.
"Everyone here love sports, especially basketball. KU has one of the best basketball teams in the nation and basketball was invented at KU. Everyone has a lot of team spirit and supports the team!"
The weather doesn't affect the experience much at all.
"There is only a bus system for public transportation and it is extremely focused on getting students to/from campus only when school is in session. When school is not in session, the bus system becomes 1/4 the size and is extremely inconvenient."
Diversity seems mostly present on campus. There is clearly racial diversity though the rest are not as evident.
"I feel safe on campus. For as many students as there are, there don't seem to be as much crime/violence as could be expected."
"Basketball is definitely the biggest sport at KU. Every other sport is free to watch, but men's basketball requires camping out for tickets. Everyone accepts this because our team is so good."
"There are labs and computers all over campus. As a design student, a downside is the cost of printing is expensive. I go everywhere on campus with my own mac."
There are a lot of foreign exchange students at KU. KU encourages students to embrace diversity and freedom of sexuality.
Living in the residence halls has a lot of restrictions. There's a lot you have to be careful of. Many students have gotten kicked out for disobeying rules.
"Buses stop all around Lawrence at many times allowing students to be flexible with their schedule. A parking pass is a little expensive, but necessary for many."
"I am double majoring. I don't regret it, but it is a challenge. With my dual major, I hopefully wont have too hard of a time finding a job."
I plan on having an internship this summer. I plan on studying abroad in Dublin. KU provides plenty of information about internships.
"The weather really effects the walk to campus. Especially in the winter when students have to walk up a snowy, icy hill."
KU requires students to go through an alcohol and drug survey.
"Expensive, but a lot of options. Three big dining areas on campus plus many small ""hawk shops"" around campus."
A lot of bars in Lawrence that are easy to walk to.
"There are a lot of places for students, like the pond."
"The KU greek community is very involved with various school and local organizations. Many greek students are on the student senate board, work on the newspaper staff, work as school ambassadors, etc. Some non-Greek students may see Greek students as partyers, snotty, or dumb. Although this is a perception for some, this does not apply to all of the Greek students. Many of the Greek students have the option to live in the Chapter house. But, of course these students have the option to live somewhere else. The chapter houses are right on campus. They are very large and decorative. The inside of the houses are very nice and clean."
"KU, of course, is well known for its basketball. Now that it is basketball season, students have gotten more excited and hyped for sports. The students at KU are very dedicated to the men's basketball team. We have students camping out before games in order to receive tickets. At the games, students hold up posters made by the student newspaper. Being involved in men's basketball is a big Lawrence tradition."
"Ku has a variety of different people that attend. There is not really any way to describe the ""typical"" students' look. There are students involved in the Greek Community that are very involved in Lawrence's community. A lot of the Greek students hold officer type positions in clubs or in Student Senate. Most of the greek students look like the stereotypical greek boy or girl. This includes preppy attire like polos, sperrys, and pastel colored clothing."
"Lawrence, KS offers a variety of off-campus housing. I currently live in a duplex off campus with 2 other people. My duplex is roomy, clean, and located in a safe part of town. The only drawback is that I have to drive to school. Fortunately, I am able to park at a friend's off-campus house and walk to school from there. It is very affordable to live off-campus in Lawrence. Many students live in apartments that are far away from campus, but these students have the option to take the bus to school."
The weather during the fall and spring is awesome but the winters are brutally cold and the summers are pretty hot and humid
The process was long and i ended up having to go in to the financial aid office to talk with someone but once i did i got the aid that i needed
"From my experience everybody usually pregames then goes out to the bars. The Hawk is a lot of fun to go to on Friday and Saturday, and the Cave is huge on Thursdays."
"Atmosphere is great here so far, everybody is welcoming. Campus is beautiful during the fall, and the nightlife is a lot of fun"
"YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED A COMPUTER! There is tons of online stuff such as homework and reading that you need to do, and the library isn't reliable."
"KU buses take you EVERYWHERE. Plus, everything is within walking distance. The only time you need to use our car is if you are in a hurry, and don't want to wait for the bus."
"Our KU ID cards can be used for almost everywhere close in Lawrence, KS. It's very convenient, and reliable."
Parking is the only horrible thing KU has to offer. Everything else is found either on campus or on Mass St.
"Regardless of what I am feeling now, I know this was the best fit for me."
"KU is known as a party school. There are constant bars, and clubs down here that are fun. Well known bars host dollar night every week, which keeps the crowd pleased."
"Financial aid would be easy to get if you knew what you were doing. KU had advisors to help assist, but since is does cost 18,000, it was fairly hard to come up with all of it."
"I feel generally safe; I would feel safer if I wasn't a skeptic. But all-in-all, the police are visible, the health department is accessible, and there are safe buses and safe rides for Thursday-Saturday."
"KU is by far one of the most accepting, diverse schools I have ever attended."
"There is never a dull moment at KU. There is so much to do. From hanging out in the Kansas union, to walking down Mass. street, KU has it all."
Mrs. E's (my dining hall) is very accessible. It just depends on the day on the quality of the food.
"Greek life is a big deal here at KU. But, like I mentioned before, if you aren't a greek, the girls don't want to talk to you at parties, but the guys are all for it. Freshman girls can't live in the houses, but the guys can."
"The guys are more open to new friends, especially the Frats. Girls usually already have found their friend group within the first week, and don't really talk to anyone outside of their group unless they need to."
"When they addressed us in orientation and meetings, they are fairly strict when it comes to the rules, they try to enforce them as much as they can. But as far as I see, it seems like anyone can get away with anything, but then again, I haven't seen much more than underage drinking, so maybe I only see the less strict opinions."
I applied for my financial aid and it went smoothly.
I don't really party but people who do seem to enjoy drinking and partying.
Everything is pretty much modern and campus is very environment friendly.
It's like any other high school but I would've preferred to have gone to a bigger school.
There always shuttles everywhere. Shuttles are convenient for everyone.
"i really dont have to many guy friends but the ones i have met are very cool. not to out there, pretty laid back. alot of them are very smart . goes to class everyday and dont party hard to much."
the atmosphere of the city Lawrence is great. its very comfortable. everyone is friendly and kind. very helpful and nice. it is just a peaceful and fun place. i am really enjoying this experience and the opportunity to be here.
strictness on campus is good. really it keeps us safe and out of dangerous/ trouble. i would rather feel safe then to be scared because the people around me are drunk and make bad decisions. having rules dont always ruin the fun.
the good thing about my dining hall is that its a cafeteria downstairs so i dont have to travel to eat unless we decide to go out or something. but the food is good. they try to change it up from time to time and healty food is always available. its always food for veggies and friends and ect.
my overall experinece so far has been great. i met alot of people from all over the world. i live in a new and totally different environment. i love it out here and i feel like i can deal with this for four more years of my life while i get my degrees.
the weather is changing around this time but its not bad. some people are getting sick but i try my best to go to class everyday. it hasnt start snowing yet but even in the rain its buses that take you to class so there shouldnt be a reason not to go to class.
The sports here are big. everyone loves them and show support. its not all about the sports but they still get showed alot of love.
the first time i applied for aid it went through but they said i didnt go online and accept my aid but i did it just did not go through. so i had to put in a reinstaement form and send it off to my school. im still having problems but we are working on it now.
"there are alot such as sports training, nursing, business, engineers, ect. anything you want to do basically KU has it. this is one reason why i choose this school because even if you dont think what your doing now is what you really want to do you always can change it."
for my major it come times were you have to put in alot of hard work. its alot of biology dealing with it partically. also you have to be very dedicated to what you are doing because this takes alot of time and effort.
to be in the program i am in now is awesome. you learn about about people and your health and the body. also you help people out alot. i really enjoy helping others.
i have not had an internship yet.
the parties around campus are fun. they are safe. it is always a way to and from parties so you dont have to drink and drive.
"to live on campus for me is very different. sometimes i feel alone because i know now that i have to be independent moving to a town by myself without my mother. but my friends and the people in my surroundings are very helpful. they also are very kind and willing to help in sense of directions and much more. its alot of fun things always going on around campus, i feel safe where i live and it is also very peaceful."
i feel very safe on campus no matter what time of day it is. there are alot of open places you can go. there are emergency phones throughout the pathway while your walking around campus. theres numbers you can call if you need help. also there officers riding around throughout the day.
There are buses that take you to and from class. safe bus on weeknights and weekends. bus shuttles are also available to the students. taxi come in use. transportation is very easy to find and the times are great so you have a ride to and from where you need to be at that time. i love the transportation at our school. no matter what the weather is you know you have a way of getting around.
Lawrence has got some good restaurants close to the school.
"Nightlife is good, but Lawrence struggles with its small town roots."
"They are doing a ton of work on campus. New engineering and business buildings, new dorms and dining halls. That being said, there are quite a few buildings that need to be renovated."
"I love the classes at KU, and there are tons of opportunities to get help if you need it."
"At KU, most of the professors are outstanding, however, there are some who could use some improvement. Workload for my Business major is pretty heavy."
everyone is pretty nice and friendly
the school is strict enough on certain issues involving peoples safety but when you start giving parking lots away for sporting events when people need a place to park and you get tickets for it even though you paid for a parking pass is ridiculous
the architecture program lacks studio space in marvin hall and money getting more computers that have the software needed
internships for architecture are not easy to get but the school definitely helps the students make contacts and find internships that can be all over the world.
On campus drinking has never been seen by myself personally except in the dorms.
there are many computer labs around campus. i spend my time in the architecture lab because the have the programs that i need because it is so specific to my degree. i wish some of the other computer labs had more architecture related programs on them.
it is crazy with kansas because we can experience all 4 seasons in a week.
restaurants are one of the best things about lawrence. there is a lot of variety and you can find hidden gems that can be described as a best kept secret in lawrence.
it is very difficult for an architecture student to get the financial aid being from missouri because of the reciprocity program. I came into the architecture program my sophomore year and was paying full tuition with my financial aid instead of a prorated price because i did not go through architecture orientation. It is a very flawed system for architecture student not entering the program on the first year.
KUs campus is extremely diverse and does not discriminate against anyone
campus life is pretty good but there is no central hub on campus. the unions are on opposite sides of the campus and wescoe beach becomes the hub and there is nothing really close to it except the underground which gets super crowded and not an enjoyable place to hang out in busy times
"There was a small amount of confusion as far as having me apply for financial aid on both campuses (Lawrence and KUMC), but it was easily worked out and I was happy with the outcome."
Lawrence is a great community.
"Food quality isn't always the best. Also, its very expensive for a college student."
I am very happy with the business program. I know the outlook on my future will be good because I got the training I needed at one of the best schools in Kansas. Business is everywhere in our world so I have no doubt that I will be able to ind a good job that will allow me to be happy.
I do plan on having a internship mainly because it's required for my mayor and because it helps gain experience in the field. I don't have any concern at all that I won't find a internship because KU has many opportunities for students to find internships. They have job and internship fairs throughout the year so there is always a opportunity.
At the university of Kansas the business program like all the other programs offered here are A+. The faculty and staff are very dedicated to help ever student succeed with each of the programs they offer. They help you find a job in your designated field and help you prepare for life outside of college. KU is probably one of the best schools in Kansas and I am proud to be a Kansas Jayhawk.
"I am in the KU School of Journalism, which is rated one of the top in the country! The difficulty level is pretty high, but it is rewarding once the classes are over and you realize how much you have learned."
"Although there are several parking garages and lots, i ave found it easier to find a spot near campus, that way you dont have to pay for a pass, and you can be near. As a senior, I live in a house two blocks from campus, o I rarely have to drive anywhere other than work."
"For me it was very difficult to receive financial aid due to my father's wages. Though my father makes a pretty penny, I was forced to figure out a way to pay for college on my own, and financial aid was a necessity. The offices at KU were sometimes helpful, depending on who you talk to, but ultimately I did everything online, on my own. I received most of the money to cover my college tuition, but I still have had to figure out a way to pay for living expenses, as well as the additional $4,000 in tuition that financial aid did not cover."
"There are alot of housesand apartment complexes to choose from, but it is important to do some research before settling with one you think you may like. The management at many of the apartment complexes around aren't very helpful, so it is important to fond which ones those are, and make decisions based on that. I always tell people to ask around before signing a lease."
"Public transportation is great around the University of Kansas. There are about 18 bus routes that run all day to and from campus, as well as around Lawrence. At night, when the buses are not running, there is SafeRide, a taxi-like service that doesn't charge, and is available to all KU students with a valid ID."
KU is accepting and comprises of all kinds of diversity. Most ethnic/racial diversity does come from international students. Sexual orientation is expressed through various clubs. Political beliefs usually are expressed around the year of voting but students have strong political beliefs for student senate.
I'm not in greek life but it doesn't dominate at KU.
"The satisfaction of on campus housing will depend where you choose to live because costs will vary for each housing option. One of our oldest dorms will be knocked down with a parking garage for students to put in its place and 2 new dorms will be added on campus. I chose a more pricey option for my dorm and I was satisfied. All my needs were met. On site laundry, study room, computer lab, common room, suite with bathroom, small living room area etc."
"I received grants and 2 loans enough to cover my tuition with leftover money each semester which I would use for rent and utilities for that semester. The amount of money that you get reimbursed will depend on the cost of tuition which will depend on what field you are studying and how much it costs per credit hour for that major. I handled all my financial aid on my own. You will need to obtain forms for loans or specific grants that aren't disbursed automatically through your FAFSA. Always apply for your FAFSA early each year as soon as you receive your tax information. First come, first serve."
"You'll find people from all over the country (Texas, California, Illinois, Minnesota etc.) Stereotypes (besides Greek life) is rarely noticeable (usually within individual clubs)"
It is kansas really haha.
Its a little far away from the main part of campus but its a great community over all.
"Prestigious programs, undergrad research from day one, and actual professors teaching the classes."
"Prestigious programs, undergrad research, and actual professors teaching the classes."
"Tons of activity every night, Lawrence is always a good time."
"Very easy to fill out the forms, and our office is always available to help."
"Campus is only a few blocks away from downtown Lawrence, and there are many different types of restaurants on Mass St to choose from."
"I have very little experience with public transportation in other areas, but I have found the bus system at the University of Kansas to be very useful. The busses are free with a student ID and they will take you close to almost anywhere you want to go. The only real issues I have with the system is the fact that there are three different busses that serve different parts of the campus. The routes are a bit awkward to coordinate and get to where you want to go on campus efficiently."
"The people at the University of Kansas are incredibly diverse. There are many different foreign students from many different places. The dominant number of students are from eastern Kansas, but there is a fair amount of students from other places. There is a good population from California and Chicago as well. The general culture is strongly based in metropolitan attitudes and dress, but it is not terribly hard to find someone from any background, including 'rednecks'. The number of girls vs. boys is fairly evenly split."
"Naismith Hall just did an amazing renovation to the lobby. Cool new fireplace lounge, large fitness room looking out at pool, ping pong/pools tables and new study rooms. Great location. And the best part, I practically have a private bathroom! Best dorm on campus by far. Love it here."
"It's Kansas; you never know what kind of weather you're going to get. One day it could be hot and humid and 95 degrees, while later in the week it could be 70 degrees and rainy. The summers are hot and humid, the winters are freezing, but the spring and fall make it worth it."
There are plenty of off-campus housing options. You can live as close or as far away from campus as you want because the school has a fantastic public transportation system
"For the middle of Kansas, Lawrence has a pretty decent restaurant scene. Most of the places students want to go are on Massachusetts St (Mass), which is only a few blocks from campus. Of course, the town also has its fair share of fast food, too."
"If you're into that scene, you're not going to run into any problems as long as you're in the privacy of your own home/apartment and you're not driving. Most people drink, though."
"Nightlife here is great, if you're into shopping and cool places to eat dinner. However, if you are under 21 and all of your friends aren't, there isn't a single place that will let you in on the average night!"
"The computer labs are further off of the main path of campus, but not usually crowded because of this. Internet speed is average."
"Rental houses are plentiful around KU, but quality is lower than low in some. Parking passes are expensive for off campus students, so houses in walking distance are key."
Campus is hard to navigate but other than that its fine.
"This is a 'white bread' state and the university reflects that. There is some diversity, but not like at some larger universities."
"They have a good science program here. At orientation, they did not however have someone from my department there for me as I was a transfer student and taking upper level courses. Still need a chem advisor."
"The dorms in McCullom hall are relatively nice, but the bathrooms are disgusting. They need to be completely remodeled. The good things in McCullom are the floor lounges. They are a great socialization place."
"Most of the dorms at KU are fantastic. McCollum is the oldest one, but it's being torn down in a few years and two new ones are being built."
"We're pretty much awesome. Basketball rules KU, but we are still spirited about all varsity sports. Even in Football where we're not at all good, the games are still sold out almost everytime."
"Drinking is very, very, very popular. Aside form that, everything else is hardly found. Marijuana is pretty popular and prescription drugs are seen around midterms and finals."
"Local atmosphere is wonderful! Lawrence is really a special town that you can't find just anywhere. Everyone loves KU and has a spirit that you can feel. On campus there is plenty of KU love, and it's impossible to not see a Jayhawk or KU shirt everywhere you go"
"Off-campus dining is awesome! Mass St. is all you will hear about at KU, and for good reason. It's funky, fun, and has the perfect mix of quirky and familiar eateries and shops. From Chipotle to the Mad Greek, there is a place for everyone. You will never get bored exploring Lawrence!"
"The KU bus system is awesome and definitely comes in handy. There could certainly be more buses going to the dorms when classes get out, but overall the experience is a good and easy one."
Since I'm just starting my sophomore year I don't feel like I've encountered any specific or unique aspects of the major I've declared. My high school curriculum was very similar to the courses I'm currently taking (heavy on math and sciences).
"Lots of food, some local spots that cater to the college crowd plus abundant availability of chain restaurants and cheap fast food. There is some ethnic and vegetarian variety, but I have mostly stuck to campus (Greek) dining halls and buying groceries."
"Starting my sophomore year, I'm now looking at continuing to pursue my Biology major with the intention of going into internal medicine. I feel like an internship at a doctor's office would be very beneficial however at this point, I have little knowledge of how to go about finding an internship or who I would speak with. Hopefully once this year gets underway I will have more of an idea on how to approach an internship."
"The dorms are pretty awful. There are I think two or three that have been renovated within the last 10 years. Basically, stay away from McCollum Hall. However, that does have the most people and the most lenient drinking and drugs policy. My whole floor smelled like weed. YAY...."
A lot of people don't care about academics here. I'd say probably 20% of the student body has declared a major by their Junior year and actually cares about said major.
There's a fairly wide variety of majors to choose from. The biggest departments are Engineering and Pre-Med.
"There is a lot of diversity here. Among the varying cultures, there are the average hairstyles and then there are brightly colored and shaved heads, there are attires that include pants and a t-shirt, pjs, suits, or some combination that someone created themself."
"I have not had run-ins with police officers nor have I had problems with professors, and in fact, I have brought two of my children with me to campus for weeks at a time as I had my children during the semesters I was enrolled."
"Not really a lot of places for under 21 crowd, but there are bars within walking distance, many downtown and you can use public transit to get to those, and there are parties fairly often if you are into partying."
The campus is within walking distance to almost any restaurant and types of food you would like.
KU is a great university for anyone. It is at the center of the city of Lawrence and has a great atmosphere.
"After graduation, I plan to become a licensed architect. Currently, I am content with my five year master's architecture program. Although the work is very time consuming, I thoroughly enjoy the challenges presented to me by my professors in my assignments. So far I have learned how to think more abstractly, how to prioritize my work, as well as use my resources efficiently to maximize the quality of my work and the reasoning behind my work. However, I keep on hearing that employment for architects is currently low and I continue to pray that I am able to find a job that can help me fulfill my dreams of building homes in developing countries."
"At the University of Kansas, I have found it hard to find scholarships. There are either very few scholarships given out by departments, or there are very few scholarships given out in general. I have found it tough to find scholarships through my university. However, Kansas offers a fair amount of grants to its students. It is more advantageous to apply for outside scholarships to fulfill my financial package."
"The three most exciting things I am aware of at Kansas are our basketball team, the architecture program, which I am enrolled in, and the school's major student organization. First, during the winter season, us Jayhawks are especially excited about basketball because this sport was originally created at University of Kansas, as well as the Allen Fieldhouse is known to be one of the country's greatest home courts. The Kansas basketball team is known for their hard working players, defensive plays, and talent. Secondly, The five-year master's architecture program provides a unique and interesting opportunity to students in their final year of the study. Students may join Studio 804 where they work in a group to design and build an actual building. Finally, members of Student Union Activities hold events everyday whether they be social or informative. These events keep the student body involved and often allow students gain new learning experiences."
"On weekends students can be spotted two miles east of campus. After a nice and leisurely walk down to Massachusetts Street, variety of cafes, restaurants, and bakeries hold the attention of all age groups. Not only are these shops convenient to get to, but they are affordable as well. Students can attain discounts through a shop's daily special or use the coupon booklet distributed on campus at the beginning of each semester. My favorite restaurant is Encore, a vietnamese and chinese cuisine that offers the best sweet and savory pad thai noodles on all of Mass. Street."
"University of Kansas' campus is very active. During the day time on Jayhawk Boulevard, people will be seen walking around with friends, standing in front of booths sharing information, or be seen sitting on the Wescoe Hall steps relaxing and/or studying. The university's organizations play a very important role in students' social and academic lives. The organizations help create a better community for their members as well as the rest of the Kansas community through volunteering, community service, and hosting events. At times when students are wanting to take a break from daily stresses of life, potter lake serves a perfect spot for reflection. Students are often seen sunbathing, or playing with frisbees, on the hill beside Wescoe stairs. Jayhawkers enjoy and make use of the amenities provided by the university to the fullest extent to make the academic year memorable through student organizations and campus use."
Far Above Average – Almost EVERYONE attends games. The school always hands out awesome swag at each game and even offers discount tickets to the students for easy access. It also helps that the teams will occasionally win championships and helps school spirit.
"There is always a party, even on Thursday nights. of course finals week is always full."
Busses run all the time day and night. They run through campus and through town.
"You will find all sorts of people at KU from athletes to nerds. We have those who live and breathe sports or greek life, but also those who are more comfortable at a local coffee shop or library. It makes it much easier to find your crowd of people."
"Ku's history is rich and colorful, and the students really feel a sense of belonging and purpose based on its atmosphere. The libraries are extremely convenient, offering resources and search engines, and are open nearly all hours of the night. Faculty, especially in the financial aid/ Bursar departments are very helpful and professional. Having a natural history museum, art museum, bowling alley, and many hang-outs on-campus is beneficial to the students, and add a sense of inclusion, as well as a fun way to kill time between classes."
"Kansas is a relatively safe state, and, in fact, Lawrence recently had it's first homicide in 10 years (no homicide is good, but that's an amazing track record). Personally, I'm more concerned with petty theft and public drunkenness; even though neither are extremely apparent, they're the only crimes I've witnessed. Overall, I feel very safe on-campus."
"Public transportation (supplied by the KU campus) was always readily avaliable, especially for those attending parties or enjoying the night life around town. Underrage drinking was apparent, but public drunkenness wasn't too big of an issue; although, I knew many people who would use fake IDs to get into clubs that serve alchohol. Being a ""college town"". there were many safe alternatives to partying at night, especially on Massachusets St."
"I was never big in the drug scene, but alchohol was a very prominant force on and off campus. The RAs usually kept a good eye on the floors, and tried their best to do so, but alchohol and marijuana undoubtedly made it's way in. However, public drunkenness and drug use was always treated with professionalism, and information was readily made avaliable on how to responsibly enjoy alchohol."
I am in the pharmD program and have an internship. It is a great job to have while in school to learn about the field and practice and apply what I have learned in the classroom.
"I am in the pharmD program, and I am looking forward to starting it. The technology that is utilized should be an asset."
They have a little over 200 majors to pick from and most have national recognition.
I feel safe on campus. Police are always driving threw and making rounds. If there are any crimes committed on or around campus alerts go out immediately and there are postings about it.
"Its Kansas wait 10 minutes and the weather will change, but for the most part the weather isn't all bad."
It's a very laid back campus and the people are friendly.
I love the transportation system at the University of Kansas. There is a bus system that is put into the cost of going to the University so all you need to do is show your ID to the bus driver. Cars are not too necessary if you just plan to stay around the Lawrence area.
I recieve a full academic to school of engineering.
"Gets a bit chilly during winter, but on the positive side, only lasting approximately 3 months."
"The main Campus Dining site for Daisy Hill residents is Mrs. E's which I would describe as better than most give it credit for. Sure, some of the food can be tasteless and bland but it's all in what you pick. Once you find out what's good, it's a very pleasant eatery."
"To be quite honest, I never really notice such thing at the University. I'm not really part of that crowd but every now and then I do see evidence of certain drug use. People in my dorm rooms were usually loud because of the alcohol they drink during the night. A party was held in my dorm in which there were obvious signs of alcohol use. The University forces you to take a course on alcohol safety which, in the end, pretty much speaks for itself."
My classes are usually big classes because they are major science classes. There seems to be a good amount of jobs doing lab research.
I think that my program is ok. My school doesnt offer the specific major I need so I am just sticking with what they have.
Everyone seems to be accepting of each other. Our campus has a lot of foreign exchange students though I do feel like the African American population is at a minority.
For two years I lived in the worst Dorms though it is nice that we have on campus apartments which is convenient. You cannot control the heat though and prices are getting to be expensive
Beautiful Midwestern ladies. Visited plenty of other colleges and would stack KU gals amongst the best any day.
"Lawrence, Kansas is great. Your quintessential college town. It's hard to imagine a place I would rather be."
They're getting annoying when it comes to Greek life but pretty chill for the most part
Literally great. They have set me up to be very successful and given me all the tools I need.
Love the professors. Great facilities. Helpful counselors. Plenty of opportunities for study abroad.
It is Kansas so weather can change in five minutes
"I haven't started quite yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I'll be beginning the PharmD program this fall."
I love the restaurants in Lawrence! There are many options. Some are fast food and some are high end places. Downtown is where many of the students go. Its probably one of the best things about living in Lawrence!
"The diversity on campus is massive. You get to meet many different people from all over the world. Most of the time they are eager to meet new people, but sometimes you have to go out of your way to talk to them. They will often group with others from similar origin.
Lawrence is probably the most liberal area in Kansas."
There is a lot of social involvement and activities that go on. The only downside is that some of the newer dorms are expensive and small. The dining hall is close and the buses take students to campus.
"Parking is pretty easy if you live in a dorm. Unfortunately, the parking on campus is limited. Especially if you're trying to study at the library at night. The parking permit prices are very expensive and just increased this year."
There is a large variety of student apartments close to campus. Some even have buses that will take students to campus from the apartment. The only issue is that some will be loud or very cheaply made (not sound proof)
"The computer labs are all over campus and easy to access. Some are more full than others. Printing is very easy, all you have to do is swipe your ID and print. You also get $8 for printing at the beginning of every semester. Sometimes the computers are slow or won't work."
I was immediately qualified for acceptance into the buisness school based on my ACT and GPA.
Love the buisness program at KU. There are so many options available to those who want to go international.
"The labs on campus are excellent and there are lots of them. Some schools, such as the Journalism school, even have their own labs. Printing is easy - send it to any building, then go to any printer in that building, swipe your ID, and print. Network is passable - it's too slow to be reliable for streaming. Wireless access on main campus is great."
"Best to use a bike. Parking is terrible, and the main road through campus is shut down in the day"
There are plenty of opportunities for internships at KU
By far the best international buisness program I have encountered
"There are tons of off campus dining options. For starters, the University is five minutes from downtown, which has chain restaurants (like Buffalo Wild Wings) and lots of local restaurants (Mad Greek, Ingredient, Genovese, etc). There's a wide variety of food - from Greek to Indian to Mexican to healthy, and at lots of different price points. Many restaurants (especially local pizza shops) offer great student discounts/specials, and they accept Beak 'Em Bucks too. The University also provides a coupon book every semester with lots of coupons for local restaurants."
"Typical Midwest weather. It's humid, which makes the summers hotter and the winters colder. Typically in the 90s and 100s in the summer, 70s and 80s in the fall/spring, and 30s-40s in the winter. But it's Kansas - the weather is really unpredictable.
Classes are hardly affected by weather. Unless it snows over a foot overnight, there will be class."
"I'd say they're pretty nice. Very nice and large rec center which you can go to as a student for free, the unions are nice with (slightly expensive but) good food available. The libraries are very large and offer plenty of help as a student looking for a book or writing a paper or if you just need a place to study they're open all the time. I'm always seeing people jog around and chill on campus. We have the concrete beach of Wescoe and a really nice valley where you can lay out if you'd like."
"As a transfer student, you might get a scholarship your first year in to KU. Other than that I found them to be lacking. You might receive one, but even then most people don't seem to think it covered very much of the tuition. I think most students rely on their parents to fund them out of potential debt."
"Basketball is HUGE at KU. Allen Fieldhouse is one of the most amazing experiences I think you'll have as a KU student. The entire place simply hums with energy when you're in there. We have a team and coach the entire town loves and supports. Football is a bit lackluster, people still go, I'd say mostly to tailgate but we have hopes that someday it will become a viable spectator opportunity soon."
As a social work major I worked very hard and liked the program.
"I don't really know much, but security is okay. Incidents have decreased, otherwise, I don't know much about the Health & Safety."
"Parking sucks, you have to be careful where you park or you'll get a ticket!"
"I did not find much, so I relied on FAFSA more or less."
"Very subjective, but everyone is different. There are pretty people and ugly people, but a very subjective question."
"Some buildings aren't great, some are better than others."
"The parking is so complicated and frustrating. There are different times that you can park in a lot, sometimes if there is an event you can't even park in the lot. On top of all that, you have to walk a long distance before you reach you destination on campus."
"KU has a campus wide drug free rule in affect. That being said, smoking on campus is permitted as long as your a certain distance away from the academic buildings and sports facilities."
"At KU, there is always a way to get around campus. Whether it be on the University buses, riding a bike/moped, or even just walking, I have had little trouble getting around campus. After 4pm, all parking on campus is open and students can park there for free. There are also multiple options for students who wish to purchase various parking permits through the KU parking department."
The athletics here at KU are a huge part of the campus life! the student involvement is incredible here and we have such a great student section at the games that I have been to it is a ton of fun!
it snow a lot here and classes never get cancelled. the one time classes got cancelled in years was this year and the dorms seem so far away from the classes. and they do a terrible job scrapping the sidewalks and pushing the snow out of the parking lots.
The night life if for students who are 21 and older. There are very few 18 and older clubs. But they do cost to get in. If you don't mind paying and enjoying yourself with a few friends out then that is the way to go. But it also depends on the bar scene you prefer. I have never been to a party on campus so I like to go out to the bars.
"Scholarships are definitely not as easy to get as I had previously thought but if you work hard, you can probably land some. The financial aid process was VERY easy and straight forward for me."
Nightlife can be found anywhere in Lawrence. There are a places for 18 and older and there are many for the 21 and older crowd. It really can be a lot of fun and a great experience.
"Greek life is everywhere on KU but it is also pretty easy to avoid if that's what you want. Personally, I'm not into the Greek life and it doesn't bother me but if you are interested, there are many ways you can become involved and there are many of them so you really do have a choice."
"I haven't encounter any internships yet, but I'm sure I will within the next year or so. It'll be something in my field, coping with hospitals, clinics, etc. Internships are always something you can feel good about, knowing your doing something special for someone or something without pay is always a good thing to look back on."
"The atmosphere is fairly nice. It's a college town, which consist of mostly students that attend the University of Kansas. They are plenty of activities that goes on during the day and night. The people are very friendly and easy going."
"I love it! I've always liked helping others out no matter the situation, so I thought entering the health field would be a excellent fit for me. The school work is getting tougher, but thats just life and welearn to get better at what we do day by day."
I don't have a food/meal plan considering that I live off campus. I shop about once or twice every two weeks.
Right now I'm just talking pre-prerequisites towards my bachelors degree. In my department you must maintain a 2.5 gpa or higher in order to continue into the KU Med Center. Tips: Focus on what you're trying to pursue. Don't expect an easy way in for any type of degree or situation. Have a positive mind-set and continue working hard!
"There is so much to offer in Lawrence. Mass St is where most of the shopping, bars and fun restaurant places are in Lawrence. Its the place to be on Thursday, Friday and Saturday night."
"The drug scene in Lawrence, KS is moderate to high. However, on campus it's not really big, depends on who you hang out with and if they are people who do drugs."
"I am a double major at KU in Spanish and Speech Language and Hearing. I do enjoy both of the programs, but I feel like the Spanish department leaves something to be desired. Half of the faculty I have loved. The others are hard to work with because they are so unorganized. I feel like this is a result of KU being a research school. All of the professors are busy with something else. It would also be nice to get out of the basement of Wescoe for Spanish classes. I really enjoy the opportunities available through the SPLH department. There is a clinic on campus for observations and practicum. They also have many undergraduate research opportunities. The intro to speech language pathology and intro to audiology classes allow interaction with clinicians and current graduate students."
Parking is awful. The permits are expensive and it's hard to find a spot close to campus. There isn't even anywhere to park for free around the health center. Remember change for the parking meters!
"Campus does have wireless in all buildings, which is very helpful. However, it can be a bit slow occasionally. Overall though, the wireless is very nice. The dorms also just switched to wireless, which is a feature I wish they had had when I lived there. The computer labs in the larger libraries fill up during busy times such as over lunch and finals week, but the smaller computer labs spread throughout campus that are less popular are a good place to look! Ku does provide some money for printing on campus, but I always use it up too fast. I feel like printing should be free for all the money we spend to go to school there."
"I gave the off campus housing a C because there are many options; however, it's difficult to find one that is in good condition, close to campus, and not ridiculously overpriced for college living. Decent apartments can be found, but usually just out of walking distance. I have also had bad experiences with management companies and have heard of other students having management that takes advantage of their college student tenants by withholding deposits or not taking care of facilities."
"Good if you have money and over 21. but otherwise its only a drinking and eating scene, we're not to heavy on clubs"
"not part of the greek life seen, they tend to make asses of themselves"
The university is in Kansas and Kansas weather is the most unpredictable weather out there. One minute it could be pouring out rain and the next the sun could be shining.
The school goes crazy during basketball seasons. We have one of the best basketball teams in the nation.
"I give living on campus a solid B, because, unlike most people I've had a lot of problems, I'm very allergic to mold and dust. And a lot of the dorms are full of dust and mold and other mysterious things, so that is something to be cautious of. Most of the dorms are very old, but there are some that have been remodeled and are a lot cleaner than the older dorms. Th dorm like is very interesting, a lot of interesting people that you'll meet living in dorms. While it is an ideal place to live on campus, it is quiet expensive, and the food is not that great, it's a great experience to have, and I encourage you to live in the dorms at least one or two years."
"Unless you're 21 and over most of the bars in town will not let you in, but there are several house parties and frat parties that are also available. But get repetitive after a while, but are still really fun to go to."
"Basketball is the main attraction for many, but in order to get into a game you must wait outside the building for several hours and this goes on for several days. It is understandable why this is done, but it is seen to be ridiculous. The games are fun and full of energy. While football is seen to be something that we shun, because we are not as good as we are in basketball."
"I give the the food and dining option on campus an A- because there is a nice variety of food selections. I wish the dining hall was still in my dorm like it was when my parents attend K.U. I have to walk two dorms over to the dining hall. It's not always fun when the weather is bad. Also there are alot of nice eateries throughout campus, which makes it convenient when you are on campus."
"The University of Kansas has a nice selection of off-campus housing. It has a range of less expensive apartments to expensive apartments. It all depends on what you are looking for that fits your budget. The apartments in the downtown area are older apartments. They are located near the bus route, which will allow you to ride to campus easily. The more expensive apartments are in riding distance as well. These apartments offer more amenities. Lawrence is known for a college town environment. Overall, the off-campus housing offers plenty parking space and are pretty safe."
The computer labs at the University of Kansas are well stocked in the dorms as well as the libraries. I have my own computer. The school has excellent WIFI throughout the campus.
"Drinking at Kansas is a very big thing, and a lot of it is being done by underage students. Therefore I would say the campus strictness is not very high."
"The transportation at Kansas is excellent. The bus system has a new bus making a pickup every six minutes, so missing a bus does not mean you will not make it to class. It also holds a lot of students."
"Living in the dorms in my opinion is a great thing for incoming freshmen. It's a great way to make friends, and stay involved with the school. Even though the dorms may not be as nice or kept up as an apartment would be, but the friendships and memories you make in them are absolutely worth it."
Anthropology is so dope and interdisciplinary. I feel very supported.
"A huge queer community (Bi,A, Trans, Les, Gay) here. Even an on-campus drag show. Several queer instructors. A very artistic town."
Very diverse. Excellent organic COOP store. A lot of tasty joints.
We have an excellent public transit system free for all KU students and staff.
"Wouldn't know about such things, I live off of campus."
Fairly everyone is materially oriented and identify themselves with the things they possess.
I do not live on campus so am not too informed on these issues.
"I don't even know what Greek life means. Is it a way of life? If so, by observing the hyper-material and sexually repressed nature of this specific subculture I see no true value in embodying any of their practices. Negligent consumers that are destroying life on this earth is what I see."
"The nightlife is pretty good. There are many things to do for students 18 and up and 21 and over. However most places that people attend are 21 and over. There are a lot of bars in our downtown area and are always packed during the weekends. People also have house parties, frat and sorority parties off campus that most people go to. There is always something to do."
"Parking is horrible. It is extremely difficult to find parking if our have a permit without getting a ticket, and even with a permit at times it's hard to find parking in the parking lot. You can't park in any parking lots during special events and game days, even with a permit. Parking is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Athletics is a very big thing at my school. Since we are a D1 school it's no surprise that almost everything is based around athletics. We have the most supportive fans and they will camp for days just to get in to a home game and travel for away games. When a basketball game is on, nothing else is Lawrence is more important. W have the best school spirit."
"Not a very diverse campus, so most guys and girls look the same. The outfits they wear are pretty similar, I.e, boat shoes, uggs, polos, athletic gear etc. Some are extremely fashionable, and some don't really care."
"The Greek life at my school is very vibrant. We have plenty of Greek houses everywhere and they always doing something. They do a lot if during during the school year, especially in the beginning so people know more about them."
"Only good if involved in school groups and clubs, otherwise you are on your own."
Freshman are able to live off- campus. Just depends on your personal preferences. Housing is easy & avaliable!
"Parking near campus at KU can be a hassel. Parking spots are limited and at times, expensive. Students must apply in advance for parking in several different areas. The best spots are still a ways from most buildings but the walk isn't too bad. Parking downtown and parking during football games is a NIGHTMARE! Police officers enforce parking policies heavily and it can be frustrating to find a parking spot that is not 2 miles from where you want to go."
"There are plenty of options close to campus with a variety of apartments, houses and town-homes. Most options are fairly priced and nice to live in."
"There are all kinds of guys at KU. Frat guys, hipsters, athletes, and just plain normal guys. Most of the girls are nice and easy to talk to!"
"The athletics at KU are amazing. This is especially true of the track program and Men's Basketball program. Every home basketball sells out and numerous websites and magazines have called Allen Fieldhouse the best place to watch a college basketball game. The fans go crazy and it gets LOUD! Despite poor success in football, the student section is always packed and game days are a lively and fun experience in Lawrence. Students also show up in large number to track events, volleyball, baseball, softball, and soccer games. In conclusion, school spirit is high at KU and so is athletic performance."
"KU is pretty terrible with providing scholarships for their students, especially compared to other large universities in the area. There are scholarships that exist, but they are almost all for very specific types of students and the vast majority do not qualify for them. They just started a new freshman scholarship program, but that was implemented after I started here so I was not included in that. If I was, maybe I would have gave them a higher grade in this category."
"It's good. There are good and bad dorms to live in, but many have been renovated lately so nearly all of them are good places to stay. The cafeteria food is good most every day, and you can eat at chain restaurants on campus with your dining plan card. Most students live off campus after their freshman year."
I have been happy with my education at the University of Kansas. I am currently majoring in Speech-Language Pathology. I have had excellent professors in my field. The head of the department sends out emails to students about research and job opportunities for students to gain experience.
Most of the girls and guys on campus seem to be athletic because they dress in t-shirts and athletic shorts. Most students seem that they are in sororities and fraternities.
"The weather is very random, so it can be difficult to figure out what to wear to stay warm. However when the weather is warm, everybody likes to go outside to study and hang out with friends. Although when it does start getting cold, there are bus systems that students use to get on campus because the dorms are pretty far from the main campus."
"I also like how some of the classes have discussion sections that students have to attend. These discussions are useful to attend because it lets you hear other students' opinions about the book material and lectures. have to say about the lectures and book readings. Some popular study areas are the libraries on campus that have computers and laptops that students are able to use. Studying at the libraries can also be helpful because you can find other groups of people that are studying for the same test, and you can work together with them."
"KU offers multiple majors that will fit anyones interest. There are several professional schools at KU including Business, Engineering, Pharmacy, Liberal Arts and Science, and Social Welfare to name a few. These programs are just a couple out of the wide variety that KU has to offer."
There are many apartments that surround campus. Some even stretch out as far as the edge of town but are connected through the bus routes that go directly to and from campus. These college friendly apartments make it easier for students to wish to live elsewhere than living on campus.
"On campus places are good but they are pretty expensive. I would recommend going off campus and venturing out to what Lawrence has to offer. The main food courts on campus are in the Kansas Union and the Underground in Wescoe Hall. These particular venues give students a wide variety of food, but at a expensive price."
The diversity is great on campus but it isnt that outstanding. There are people from many different ethnic backgrounds and are inclusive in their activities and open to the public. But you have to dig deep in order to find these particular groups on campus.
Theres almost everyone for someone out there. If you look hard enough you will find yourself surrounded by thousands of people with the same interests.
"The students at the University of Kansas come from all over the country as well as internationally, so there is a range of students. The ones that I have built friendships with are very nice, outgoing and well rounded. We all pretty much dress in tee shirts and jeans. We sometimes dress up for special occasions. Overall most students where the school's logo shirts and blue jeans. Most students develop friendships on their wings of the dorms and mainly socialize with them."
The University has such an excellent bus transportation system most students use daily. There are parking garages and parking spots throughout the campus. I don't have a car on campus so I am not sure how much parking permits are. I take the bus everywhere on campus and it works out really well for me.
My friends and I have found some clubs downtown near campus. We have always had a good time. We also go to fraternities parties and other on campus parties. We have always had a good time and have meet a lot of new people. They have transportation to these locations on campus.
"I have always felt safe on campus. They have evening buses for students to use to and from campus. There is campus security to escort students to cars and different destinations. Overall, I rearly heard of any crime activities on campus."
"As a biology major/ premed, I will be working for an orthopedic surgeon this summer. My responsibilities will include observing surgeries and office administration. I hope to acquire the experience and knowledge that will add to my portfolio for future references."
"I am a biology major and am very happy with my major. The courses I have taken have been very beneficial towards earning my degree. Although, the courses have been somewhat challenging, I have persevered to maintained good grades. I would not do anything different. I am very happy how my education is progressing. My career goal is to become a pediatric cardiologist and practice in a hospital that has an excellent reputation in child medicine. I hope my career choice will have a promising outlook for me in the future."
"Computers and printers are available. Wireless access is available but subpar. A personal computer is not absolutely necessary, but it is more convenient than having to go to the library to use a computer, especially during crunch times like finals. A printer is not necessary and most people do not have them; the printers are located at various locations around campus, and while there is a fee of 8 cents per page, it works fine."
"I have used the campus and Lawrence transit systems regularly to get to class and stores in the community. It is available throughout the day every day but Sunday, and there are many different routes. All routes are free for KU students. The only complaint I have is the lack of nighttime routes. If I have a function on Mass Street past 8 p.m., I have to walk home (which is doable but not recommended). However, Lawrence is implementing a nighttime route service (that will unfortunately have a cost for KU students)."
"My experience with campus housing has been optimal. I lived in Ellsworth and Templin, and both are more recently renovated dorms on Daisy Hill. I made some of my best friends through living on my floor in Ellsworth freshman year, and we did many things together and became closer than most floors become. I lived in Templin sophomore year and had a different experience (the dorm is known for being quieter and more academic-minded), but I enjoyed it nonetheless. There's a reason I continued living in student housing after freshman year."
"Sports at KU are essential to the atmosphere of the campus. People go to football and men's basketball games -- every game. Men's basketball is the main sport on campus, and we regularly do well and make it to the tournament. The other sports are not as popular, but as a volleyball fan myself, I find that when Jayhawks are playing, the people will come."
"We have all sorts of guys at KU from city boys, country boys, athletic, rednecks, africans and foreign. The girls here are most likely Soroity girls, groupie girls ( for our Mens Basketball team) .They are attractive and smart and if you are not a Jayhawk girl then no man will want you we are the Cutest and Smartest."
"F***ing hot all the way through January, and then it became f***ing cold and made us miss school with a s*** ton of snow in March and stayed cold all the way until the beginning of May. KANSAS!"
"You want to drink? Head to the Hawk if you're under 21. Over 21, right next to Mass. St. Want to eat? Head to Mass, or get delivery. Free cosmic bowling in the Union. Usually a movie is playing there too. SafeBus is free to ride, and goes through Mass, if you don't mind wasted kids. Also, fast dorm internet means you can have a great night in too, watching the Netflix."
"The food at Mrs. E's is pretty alright, the floors tend to become a close knit community, and Ellsworth and Templin are nice places to live. McCollum is a s***hole though, because it is the oldest."
"You have to have a parking pass to park anywhere on campus, and, even those are limited!"
"There is only one main bar where you can drink underage--The Hawk. Other than that, there isn't much but house parties."
KU basketball is half the reason I come to this school. Athletics are a big deal.
So many good restaurants downtown! And all the delivery places will deliver food to you at the library at 3am so that's a plus.
"It's really not that strict here. Our campus has been known to have some pretty high amounts of underage drinking and although the official word from KU is that they are strict, they actually really aren't. It's strict enough that you'll be safe from crazy drunks though!"
"Very diverse, something for everyone. It really is the most diversity you're going to find anywhere in the state of Kansas."
The process is that you are required to have a certain gpa. once that is handled you need to fill out an application and a drawing of your shoe to test your drawing skills. that's the basics of the application process.
I have yet to have one but it is required and they help you along the way to get you into a internship.
At the moment i have yet to be accepted in to the architecture program but i'm sure it would be fun. Getting my basic requirements them self are fun so i can't wait.
I'm in University of Kansas and the majors that i am interested in is architecture. The architecture program is a well known program and is hard to get in but well worth it. its also very hands on and gives you the experience that is needed.
People sell Adderall for finals outside the classrooms. Weed smoking while walking to class
"Good facilities. But, if you are not part of the sororiety or frats you have no life."
"There's pretty much any kind of person you can think of here. There's a massive amount of preppy, sorority/fraternity types as well as lots of more alternative sort of people. Lawrence itself is kind of an offbeat town so you'll meet a lot of different people. The school is so big that you're bound to find someone you like. Some of the people can be kind of stuck up and snobby though."
"I lived in Hashinger and there was only 4 computers. The 2 Macs wouldn't open documents and the mice often were stolen or disappeared so it usually was more like one computer. The printer broke a lot as well. I'd definitely recommend bringing your own laptop, though I will warn that ResNet (the internet you are Required to buy) constantly goes down."
"Unless you apply by November 1, you won't get any scholarships at all and the ones that you do get are usually pretty small."
"A lot of the classes are taught by TAs so it's likely that you are paying to be learning math or econ by someone only a year or two older than you. Until you get in higher level classes the class may consist of upwards of 600 people. One of my professors last semester even had to have a microphone to teach. The professors for the most part are really great but it's hard to get a one on one experience unless you're in the honors college, and the requirements for it are so difficult that if you had the qualifications for it that you'd be going somewhere other than a basic state school."
I never felt really safe on campus. I didn't join a lot of clubs because I didn't want to have to walk alone at night and there wasn't any transportation after 5:30 except on the weekends. There was also an armed robbery not far from my dorm on campus so it's really scary sometimes.
"The process of getting into the School of Engineering for Chemical Engineering was relatively simple. In order to get in, High School grades must be up to par, as well as ACT scores. There are prerequisites for the Engineering program regarding each individual score on the ACT for each individual topic. After applying to the School of Engineering, you will receive a letter in the mail stating whether or not you got in."
"There are a lot of options for housing; although, a lot of the housing has various stereotypes that are proven to be true. The only dorm that does not have a viable stereotype is Ellsworth. Oliver reserves the stereotype as being sketchy, just like McCollum, Templin is very intellect orientated, which is not a bad thing. If one can see past the stereotypes and think positive, it will definitely be a great experience no matter what."
"Sports are supported by not just students, but all around the town. You could greet people with a rock chalk and most likely they would say jayhawk, and it doesn't get much better than Allen Fieldhouse"
Social scene is awesome mostly all the students are friendly and full with school spirit. KU also has tons of programs ranked in the top among the nation.
Lots of buses for class. SafeBus and SafeRide is awesome so you don't drink and drive.
"I lived in Ellsworth Hall in a 2 person room. Our room had a sink, cabinets, and mirror. We lived directly across the hall from the community bathroom. People who live in suites on the floor never used the community bathroom. A total of 12-15 people on the floor used the community bathroom."
"Most of the nightlife is for 21 and up. There are still opportunities to have fun if you are underage. You can always find really fun house parties to go to because there is always one going on. If those aren't your thing then there are usually campus activities you can go to every now and then through the schol halls and dorms. The music scene is GREAT for anyone. There are multiple spots downtown where you can see music groups. A great way to scope out events is going to like coffee shops, stores downtown, and buildings on campus for fliers that are posted on bulletin boards."
"I love the restaurants downtown! If you don't want the typical fast food kind of places then I would stick with mass street. My favorite place is The Burger Stand! They have vegan, vegetarian, and meat eater options, and the food is AMAZING. There are some restaurants that are kinda expensive, but there are still great cheap places to eat. Another great place would be Pepperjax. Soooo good!"
"The dining hall food is ok, but you get tired of it pretty quickly. I would suggest bringing little meals of your own if you are able to when you want to change things up. If you don't have time during the day you can always pack food the night before to take with you."
I feel that our school has some of the best transportation.
"I love our computer labs, but the wireless internett in the dorms we have to purchase and it doesn't always work good."
"I like the classes for my degree, they really challenge you in keeping you interested in several specific masters you could pursue."
"Weather in Kansas is crazy, one day it's snowing the other it's giving you a sunburn. We've had snow and 70 degree weather in the same week. However, when it's nice out campus is awesome."
"Like most schools, some classes are easy and some are difficult. Most professors care about what they are teaching and have experience in their subjects. Classes taught by TAs are great because they are closer in age and are more relatable."
Getting into the business school requires you to take pre-requisite classes(weed-out classes so some are more difficult). Then you have to apply and wait to hear if you go in or not. The Business school is very well respected and has great connections.
Greek life is present. Ever guy's first question is are you in a sorority which can be annoying when you aren't. They have events all the time but there is so much more to do in Lawrence that you don't have to be greek to have a good time. So many groups and athletics that offer the same things as greek life.
"There are multiple computer labs on the KU campus, you can always find a open computer. The wireless is easy to connect to. There are computers set aside for only quick printing which is very nice, every student also is given a set amount of free printing at the beginning of each year."
"Lawrence is a great city with a lot of options. We have basically everything we need there, shopping/ dining/ movies etc.
Also, Kansas City is only about 30 minutes away so you can have a big city feel close by if you want."
"So far I have liked a lot of my professors and some have been very helpful.
I have been very pleased with most of my classes and have a good balance of hard work and feel challenged at the same time."
"The campus police are ready and available to enforce the strict rules of underage drinking and speeding in vehicles.
Also, they will randomly check for fake identifications at the local bars."
"There are plenty of options with the public transportation here on campus.
I know plenty of people who are satisfied with this."
"We have campus police, but it seems like they are performing more traffic violations on the outskirts of campus rather than actually assisting/patrolling campus at night. There are a number of safety phones placed throughout campus. KU uses an alert system that texts and emails when something is happening on campus. It is very specific and very quick. However, campus seems pretty dark at night. While there are usually a number of students out and about, it can be a bit creepy at times when walking back to the dorms or to your car by yourself."
"The weather is typical Kansas weather. The only downfall is that main campus is up on a hill. When it is cold and windy, it is extra cold and windy on the hill. However, there are buses to get you to class when the weather is bad. Campus has a number of places to lounge and relax when weather is beautiful."
"It is a bit of a preppy school at KU. It is very Greed oriented, with a number of fraternities and sororities. There is a strong emphasis placed on self-care and attention. Campus is really split into thre groups: Greeks, GDIs (Goddamn Independents), and athletes. Both girls and guys tend to travel in packs. There is a bit of diversity, including a large acceptance and welcoming of the LGBT community. KU is welcoming of everyone and every type of person. While campus has 30,000. it is easy to become friends with people. Campus has a small feel as everyone is friendly and wants to be friends with everyone. There isn't that desire to avoid that awkward, ""ohhh, you're in my class."" People tend to get to know each other quickly and are not shy to become friends with anyone and everyone."
"We have a large and easy to figure out bus system on campus. It is free to all students. With this option, there is also a safe bus offered on the weekends. This bus runs through our main going out street and stops at a number of residential stops to safely deliver students from their outings to home to discourage drunk driving. Beyond this is an opportunity called Safe Ride. It is a service offered free to KU students that will pick you up from a locaiton and deliver you home, no questions asked, no feel required."
"I don't personally ride the buses, but I always see them running and if, for whatever reason, I needed to ride the bus, it would be very easy for me to find one. They even have the Jo from Johnson County come, which would make it very easy for me to get a ride home if my car broke down."
"As far as I know the cost of a parking permit is reasonable-until you factor in that during basketball season you get kicked out of the spot you paid good money for. Even though this college is big on basketball, there is no excuse to kick STUDENTS out of the STUDENT parking lots."
Lawrence isn't huge but it's bigger than where I grew up. There seems to be plenty of things to do around town and Clinton lake isn't too far off.
"Something for everyone in this town! Drinking or no drinking, there's millions of options."
"Student Health services are not the greatest, but safety is good."
KU is pretty big on drug and alcohol safety. They have us take a short mandatory class almost every semester for it... It's a little time consuming but at least you learn something that you didn't know before.
living on campus is awesome. It is always easy to stay involved in activities living on campus
The price was reasonable and I could usually find a decent spot.
"Kansas basketball is quite possibly one of the most appealing factors of the university. Allen Fieldhouse is electrifying and dynamic, and the football program is looking to take a positive turn this year a under second-year coach. Never before have I seen a student body rally behind a basketball team like the students at KU rally behind theirs."
"Campus feels incredibly safe. Campus security is constantly patrolling to ensure that if an issue ever DOES arise, it is taken care of swiftly and accordingly."
"Tons of bars and other places to hang out for people of all ages. Everything is accessible, no car/cab is needed for a good time!"
"In regards to racial/ethnic diversity, the University of Kansas is predominantly white. There are many students with different ethnic backgrounds, but they only make up a small percentage of the student population. I personally see more diversity in the students' religious beliefs and sexual orientation. Through my experience, I've met many people at KU with different religious belief systems or lack of a religious belief system, making it a place where anyone is bound to fit in. One may also find that there is a vast array of sexual orientations here; gay or lesbian couples can be seen holding hands while walking to class and there are student organizations, such as LGBTQ, that both people of those sexual orientations and straight people who support those orientations can be a part of. No matter what feature one has that makes them diverse, this school is very accepting and respectful of everyone and his or her differences."
"The University of Kansas campus, though large, feels very safe to me. There are emergency telephones dispersed around campus, the campus police (who are actual police officers, not just security personnel) are always patrolling the area, and there are multiple street lamps throughout campus as well. Students can be seen alone on campus at almost any time of day or night, so it seems to me that most people feel safe here. Some people put so much trust into their environment and fellow students that they even leave their property unattended at the library if they need to take a phone call or go to the restroom (I have done that before). However, it is just as important to take security measures into your own hands no matter where you are, such as locking your car doors, using the buddy system at night, being aware of your surroundings, and keeping an eye on your personal items. In terms of health, the student health center is a high quality facility with a fully capable staff. I have been there many times for many different reasons and have gotten upstanding treatment (and prices) every time. Unfortunately, the facility is closed for most of the weekend, which can put students in a bind, especially those who are conscientious of their money. Overall, I'm glad to say I've never had a bad experience with health and safety at the University of Kansas, nor do I forsee myself having one."
"The biggest ""drug"" used at KU is alcohol, regardless of age or location. Everyone here drinks and they party hard."
"I didn't receive any aid but since entering the school, KU has revamped their renewable scholarship program so even if you don't qualify for financial aid, you can still get free money every year based on your ACT/SAT score or your GPA entering school."
"Lawrence is one of the best college towns in the nation. It is a very vibrant place and there is always something to do. Downtown Lawrence is a lot of fun with its unique restaurants, shops and bars. Nearby Clinton and Perry lakes offer mountain biking/fishing/etc. Lawrence is a beautiful town during the Spring/Summer/Fall months and is a really enjoyable place to walk around. Cost of living is low while quality of life, especially for college students, is high."
"Lawrence is regarded as one of the best college towns in the nation for a reason. For the 18+ there are a couple clubs, tons of house parties, open frat parties, and you can get into the Hawk by using a joke of a fake ID or simply passing said ID back in line. Fakes are very common and can get you in to nearly every bar in town (not Louise's or The Sandbar though)."
"Lots of options from apartments to old Victorian style houses. If you are into partying, the student ghetto or some of the larger new apartment complexes are definitely for you. If you want to live somewhere quieter there are many rental options in family oriented neighborhoods. Rent in Lawrence is very cheap. A few of the houses are run down, but you can usually avoid those by looking for a place early in the year. To find the best house for August you should start looking around December/January. Parking is never usually a problem and there are many options within walking distance to campus."
Lots of options in the Union and Underground. Lots of snack type cafes around campus especially in the libraries. You can use Beak 'em Bucks at many places around Lawrence.
"Absolutely beautiful campus! Many state of the art buildings that offer the latest technology. With a very large number of majors to choose from its safe to say Kansas will have something for you if your interests change during your college experience. If you are into watching sports, there is no better place to watch a college basketball game in the world. Allen Fieldhouse is the mecca of college basketball. Even if you aren't into basketball, you will be by the time you graduate. Football games are fun too, even if we don't win. There are a million groups to get involved with on campus whether you want to support a cause or make new friends. Lawrence is one of the best college towns in the nation with its unique social scene, locally owned restaurants/bars, and a thriving nightlife. Rent is cheap as are the drinks!"
KU provided me with the education to get my dream job in engineering! They prep you for the outside world and are eager to help you find a professional job or internship. The course load can be strenuous but when you land a sweet job you will think it was worth it. Lots of major-related projects to get involved with that add to your knowledge and experience. Campus is beautiful with plenty of library space to post up in and study.
Great and informative financial aid office. Always available to answer questions.
"I'm not into drugs, but I am into partying. Never been pressured into anything. If you are into weed, you won't have a problem finding it. At the same time, I have never been bothered by it. Lots of friendly pot-heads in Lawrence."
Lawrence is a great town for foodies. Many local owned options. This small town can easily hold its own against major cities.
Lawrence is definitely a college town. The Jayhawk can be seen everywhere around Lawrence. Most of the local people are very involved with KU basketball and are very friendly with KU students. There are many places to go to around Lawrence including Mass street. On the weekend Mass street is always busy and if you are willing to drive farther you can go to Kansas City.
KU is probably one of the most prideful colleges in the US. Most of the students are very involved in campus activities and sports. There is something on campus for everyone. Many students frequently work out at the rec center located right next to Oliver. The night before tests you can always find students crowded around tables cramming or in the many study rooms available. There is always something going on at the Union and even when there isn't anything you can always find many people there meeting up with other people.
"There are many options for off-campus housing. Some are very expensive and some are pretty cheap. The cheapest I know of is called Meadow brooks and it's very close to campus and the public transportation there is also pretty convenient. Some of the nicer off-campus apartments are the Grove and Legends. They are very nice but more expensive. The good thing is that even though they are more expensive, they are still cheaper than the dorms."
"Living in the dorms is possibly one of the most important experiences I had in college. It's a great way to meet new friends, hang out, and learn. I currently live in Lewis and I love the atmosphere, the way the rooms are set up, and the proximity to the dining hall and bus stop. Hashinger is also a great dorm; it's also close to the dining hall and it's where The Studio is located. Even though McCollum is much older than the other dorms, it's where you can meet a lot of new people."
"As I mentioned previosuly, I have been at the University of Kansas for two years now. I have gotten to know some wonderful teachers, awesome peers in my School of Social Welfare and have learned so much. The reason why I gave this facility an A- instead of an A+ is that the University does not have a lot of diversity. I believe diversity is important an any college due to the fact that diversity brings other cultures, backgrounds, beliefs, values, and so on into a community. MORE diversity in KU would win an A+ for me."
There are buses that can take you anywhere on campus so there really is no need for a car if you live on-campus. Public transportation is also really helpful if you live off-campus; there are always buses near most of the apartments. The only problem is that buses usually stop running in the late afternoon. If you are stuck out late at night you can always contact safe-ride and they will take you back home no matter where you are in Lawrence.
"I transfered to KU from a community college in 2011, I wish i could have gone to KU my four years of college. I have enjoyed meeting so many friendly, outgoing people. There are many organizations to join, where you can meet people, get involved and make friends. There is nothing I regret about attending this Univeristy!!"
"Lawrence has so much to offer- mostly on Mass Street. The music scene is awesome, and local events are always going on: like parades, block parties, art in the park, the sidewalk sale, etc. There's a lot to do around town if you're actively looking for opportunities."
"The state of Kansas's weather is bipolar. Yesterday, it was 85, today it was 52 and there are still snow piles on the ground from last week."
There is a lot of very nice houses to choose from around KU. I pay about $350 for a very big place. On-campus living is another good choice if you do not mind dealing with RAs.
"Availability and Affordability – The University of Kansas is a very large school, but each of the seven libraries has computers open to students, and tons of printing areas. One may simply rent a laptop for a few hours for free, using their i.d. Printing does cost $0.08 per page, but each semester every student gets 100 free pages of printing, and in some areas of study, printing is free (ex. Engineering)."
"I would say it's pretty safe. I mean there are people that do drink or smoke weed, but overall you don't see a lot of it out. There really isn't a pressure for you to do that kind of stuff."
I haven't ever had times that I felt unsafe on campus. There are always safety phones you can use in case of emergencies and it's easy to alert campus police if something happens.
"There are a lot of places (clubs, bars) on Mass street that you can go to, for both 18+ and 21+, and there are usually house parties every weekend, where you can go for free or just pay a small fee (like $5). Student organizations also organize parties quite often, so you will not miss out on the party scene no matter who you are."
"The dorms are standard, bunk bed rooms. There is plenty of space, good parking, and several cafeterias and shops on campus close to the living quarters."
"There aren't many drugs or drug consumers, most people drink occasionally, but it is generally not a big problem. The university does take care of its residents and drinking as well as consuming drugs is not allowed on campus."
Lawrence has something for everyone. Lots of shops and bars and places you're sure to find something that suits you.
"With everyone complaining about obesity in America, KU is extremely fit. The best part about KU is that there is a style of person for everyone. It is not solely sorority girls or hippies or hipsters, KU has every sort of style available."
"The buses are now included in your fees, something that upperclassmen my freshman and sophmore year complained about. However, nobody seemed to mind after the first snow. The buses are great on campus but can be late if you rely on them for transportation from your home or apartment."
"Campus is very safe and police are very quick to respond. Their presence after dark is definitely felt. Incidents do happen, it is a school of nearly 25,000 people in a town of 100,000. The one thing that they are improving since my undergraduate years is lighting in neighborhoods surrounding campus and near downtown. This could still be improved."
"The University of Kansas is commonly downgraded and stereotyped based solely on admission standards (which are dramatically changing). However, the University is tremendous in its rigorous academics, great professors, and definitely a strong study abroad program."
"Living on campus sucks. It's expensive, the food is horrible, and parking is a pain."
The area is very different from the rest of Kansas. The downtown area is fun and has a bunch of restaurants. But I do not enjoy the weather here. It makes it hard to go out in the winter because it is so cold and the summers are blistering and dry.
It is a good school but kind of a joke. Anyone can get in and they claim they are all these good things when really it doesn't mean crap because the are the only school out here.
"Nightlife here is alright. There are plenty of bars and clubs for anyone 21 and over, and a couple of dance clubs that accept 18 and over, but those are harder to come by. For freshman, it's easiest to hit up the house parties (and there are plenty, believe me) down by Memorial Stadium. SafeBus and SafeRide make it pretty easy to get around without a DD."
"I wouldn't suggest walking around KU alone at night for very long. My freshman year, the spring of 2012, there were two separate attacks of girls walking on campus on Friday nights. (They weren't horribly harmed). That and people will steal anything if it isn't locked up. But Campus Security is around and we do have a safety system in place."
"The KU bus system is pretty solid. It's usually relatively on time (give or take 5 minutes) and has enough lines to get you where you need to go whether you live on campus or somewhere else in Lawrence. (And free for KU students, though some lines require you to show an ID). SafeBus runs every Thursday-Saturday night and while I love that they have it, it takes forever to come. Find some other way to go out during the winter- you'll freeze to death waiting for it."
"Most of the people I've met in classes are all right. It's the ones who live in my dorm who are irritating. Most of the girls dress in yoga pants/leggings all the time (even in winter) or in minis and boots. The guys dress sloppily most of the time. Maybe I'm just biased against such attire, but I don't think that's what they ought to be wearing to class and around campus."
"I'm majoring in Classical Antiquities (ancient Greek and Roman culture, very cool). The instructors are polite and available when you need them, as well as being highly qualified and knowledgeable. I'm only a freshman, so I can't tell much, but the head of the department often sends out emails about graduate programs at other colleges and notifies us of scholarship and study abroad opportunities also."
"KU obviously has an amazing basketball team, and most of their other sports are good. However, the fan base is rabid, and if the teams have less than optimal performance, it bashes the players, the opposing team, and anyone who questions such crazed devotion.
The rec center is fully equipped and available to any student with their ID."
"The classes I have taken are challenging but rewarding. The professors are friendly and always willing to answer questions. If you want to get a B or an A, study often and do the work, and you will receive a good grade."
"For students living on-campus, many restaurants are nearby on Mass Street. I don't eat at restaurants much, but the options range from ethnic Greek and Arabic to burgers to vegetarian to ice cream. I you want it, chances are that it'll be there."
"If you're into the Greek scene, go to the Hawk! There's also the Cave, and Chateau too.There's always Mass St. too where places will be bumping, like the Jazz Haus, the Granada, the Hookah House..."
KU has a alot of good majors to chose from. It's not to difficult to double major or minor either.
I would not do the BS in Economics. The math classes tore up my GPA. I would probably do a business major because it's easier to do well there and the internship opportunities are way better.
"Goof Facilities – The Watson Health Center is good, there are always people on hand to check things out and appointments can easily be set up."
"Some schools require you to take Gen Eds before admissions, like the Business and School of Education. But others allow freshmen with good records to be admitted at once."
"KU has plenty of majors including the more obscure ones like Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies and Petroleum Engineering to name a few. Most departments are very helpful in finding internships and jobs as well."
The housing off-campus are excellent. The pros are that the housing off campus are close and available buses to take students to class or parking in campus if you chose to drive to campus. The student are available to get transportation that is offered by the school. The housing off campus are safe and convenient.
The University should add more parking for students. The cost for the parking is reasonable however.
"The campus is fairly safe, but there have still been reported attacks and muggings, and the like. There are ""areas of rescue"" lights with 911 buttons, but they are spaced very far apart. I have night classes, and, these do not make me feel any safer than I would without them."
"There is quite a lot of diversity on the campus, but the only flaw is that people from different countries and cultures tend to travel in ameoba-packs and make sidewalk travel a little difficult at times."
"Lawrence is a beautiful town filled to the brim with all kinds of hipsters and academics. The restaurant scene is absolutely glorious -- nearly everything on the main drag is local, and everything has history. The student slums are somehow not too terribly slum-ish, and almost every home has some wonderful quirk about it. Very artsy."
"Most of the computers work just fine, but I have had some trouble with the online portion of math classes on different levels of Watson. The availability of computers depends on how bad you need to get something done. If you have 3 minutes until class time, you're screwed. If you show up at 8 in the morning with a fresh coffee and papers to print ahead of time, the computer gods will smile on you with generosity and favor."
You can find anyone you want. Any genre of partner is to be found. The campus is especially great if you are LGBT.
"Finding parking when and where you need it is hard. Very hard. I have my car with me, but I never drive it to class. Walking won't get you a parking ticket. The permits are hella expensive, and everything, if a video game, would be considered ""expert"" levels."
"Parking on campus can be confusing, if not nearly impossible. There are several different lots, each with their own color. Parking passes will only allow you to park in a certain lot (for example, a parking pass for the dorm parking lot doesn't guarantee you access to all the parking lots across campus). It's difficult to determine which lots you're allowed to park in, on certain days, at certain times, with or without a pass. Often, the lots aren't marked well, making it more difficult to determine where you can and can't park. And parking is pretty strictly enforced, so parking in the wrong lot could get you a $25 ticket."
"I'm a Resident Assistant in the dorms at KU, so I'm familiar with the policies and what happens if you break them. Since KU is a dry campus, no alcohol is allowed anywhere on campus (including the dorms) for any reason. If you're caught in the dorms, you are written up and have to schedule a conduct hearing with a supervisor. Based on the situation, they will assign an appropriate punishment, such as taking an alcohol education course or writing an essay about their behavior. In the dorms, residents can also be written up for multiple noise violations after quiet hours, disrespecting staff, being in possession of illegal drugs, vandalism, etc."
"Lawrence, Kansas is definitely a college town. Because the university and the city are so closely intertwined, the school spirit doesn't end when you walk off campus. The Jayhawk is a one-of-a-kind mascot - and you'll see it everywhere! The school spirit here can't be beat. Our men's basketball team is fantastic, the students are proud of their school, and even the locals aren't afraid to sport the crimson and blue. On game days, the campus is electric, and watching a basketball game in Allen Fieldhouse is an unreal experience. Mass Street is the main cultural vein through Lawrence, and there are tons of great places to shop and eat. There's always something new to do on campus, and with so many student groups, there's bound to be something for you. The best part is that the school spirit will follow you across the country. The Jayhawk is one of the most widely recognized college mascots in America, so no matter where you go, you'll see someone smile your way, tip their hat and say, ""Rock Chalk!"""
"I lived in Lawrence my entire life and the Jayhawks were my team. I came to KU because I thought it would be my home away from home but I immediately got slapped in the face.

The girls I met were really snobby and materialistic. They only cared about their sorority and their alcohol. I didn't realize that the only way to have fun on this campus was to drink. If you don't drink, it's really hard to have a good time."
"I am an environmental studies major. Finding interesting people to talk to is never hard, however, I'm having a hell of a time finding a minor that I won't have to scrimp and save for the extra classes. I feel like some of the other majors get more attention and funding."
"Everything is walking distance on campus. If you're headed to the far reaches of somewhere, there are buses that go everywhere. Buses that are free, with really awesome drivers. Biking culture is huge-- people are on bikes all year round. Driving, however is discouraged by comparison. Having a car is quite useful for going other places in town, but the parking permits will cost you your favorite limb."
"Courseload varies; take care when scheduling, the professors are about half and half as far as quality goes. The registration process sometimes can be a little stressful, especially if you're a baby freshman."
"The food isn't fancy, but it's manageable. Certain meals get old, as any would, but there is fair variety. I don't think it's well suited to vegans, and it is very expensive compared to how much I spend at the grocery store to feed myself what I actually want to eat"
"I don't feel a rating is accurate, because I'm from Kansas and I understand Kansas weather. It's warm then cold in the same day. Expect Kansas weather if you're coming to KU. If you want warmer, obviously choose somewhere consistently warm."
"I didn't realize, as the first child going to college, that when you applied to the school you should also apply for financial aid/scholarships. I'm not sure why there's even an option not to, but somehow I chose that. The 4-year renewable scholarships are only open to incoming freshman, so I have no way of getting financial aid from KU now that I know. Outside scholarships have processed and are easy to handle, however."
"Campus has tons of history and just seeing the old architecture on buildings is pleasing. Tons of places to study, tons of tradition, and always an activity going on"
"I lived in Templin Hall, which was nice because we had our own living area and a shared bathroom between 4 instead of the entire floor. Being on campus is a luxury for proximity. The meal plan is pricy, however, and some dorm policies are strict. A good RA can make your dorm experience. Housing process isn't too hard"
"Great Rec center, Basketball atmosphere is amazing, tons of clubs and success in other sports like Track and Field. Friendly staff everywhere"
You may have to walk but there is always a spot somewhere on campus
Everyone is diverse and very friendly and many different races.
"The weather is changing everyday, could be snowy/sweaty/rainy on any given day. The KU buses will always be your best friend in bad weather. And buy yourself an umbrella."
"You just have to decide to do it, and then you're in...for my department at least. No gpa requirements or specific classes to take first."
"There are many times when you are unable to get a computer for schoolwork because they are all being taken for personal use. Also, the limited amount of free printing is very annoying."
I have always felt safe on campus. I have never felt at all threatened and there are always helpful people around I were to be in an emergency situation.
"Best to bring your own in order to avoid having to share or get administrator approval to download the latest java, adobe, etc."
"Great professers, great student to teacher ration, and work is manageable with extracurricular activities if you put in the effort."
"For the tuition prices and other college costs, you recieve a quality educationa and great college experience."
"First off, most of the campus is completely closed to student motor traffic during the day, and as such, parking options are more limited than you might find at some other universities. Furthermore, the parking police at KU are extremely diligent- unless you procure a parking permit early on and do everything by the book, it can be difficult to avoid fines (although they are thankfully small, on the $20 scale). Finally, if you must drive, arrive at least one hour before your earliest class; parking fills fast."
"Given the vast population of KU and the many countries and corners of the United States that it draws from, there are many attractive guys and girls of all cultures! In general, individuals are also fairly attractive, so that's a definite plus.

As one might expect, however, pickings get more slim in the hard sciences and school of engineering- girls are few and far between in most engineering classes, and guys tend to be a little more introverted. That said, there are still plenty of guys and girls of all types within these majors."
"The dining hall experience at KU is decent enough- getting one's needed nutrition is certainly easy and at no point do you have to stomach unpalatable foods, but mass-produced, processed food is mass-produced, processed food. In short, you won't cheer, but it will keep you full and decently happy."
"I am not going to say that Greek life in not important at KU, but it is not completely going to ruin your life forever if you do not join. All of the Greek houses are beautiful and if the frat/sorority you fall in love with happens to be on West Campus Road, all the better for you - it's in the middle of campus and great for walking to any and all classes."
"I love the Genetics program (this in turn includes the Biology department). As you get into higher-level classes, there are so many opportunities to take a course that you will actually enjoy - compared to the general education requirements that are so awful. I personally don't really have any worries about finding a job as a researcher, but if that doesn't work out I would feel very comfortable getting a position as a scientific writer."
"KU has the greatest basketball program, let's just get that straight right now. In terms of academics, our honors program is unrivaled. There are so many opportunities to make the time you spend here your own. You can study abroad, go greek, join one of the over-600 clubs. There is truly something for everyone here."
"KU has traditions that cannot be rivaled by any other school. In terms of aesthetics, sure - some of our buildings are the prettiest (here's looking at you Wescoe) but they all serve their purpose and give campus a great feel. The libraries are fantastic, the rec is great, and I don't even really need to mention the Field House."
"The Shuttle is very good about picking people up everywhere, and no matter what people have cars to take you places...or you can walk."
"KU has everything to offer, there is never a dull moment in this community. Everything that you need is there for you and is super close!"
Amazing school spirit! Especially when it comes to basketball! Allen Field House is the best place to go to a game.
I would say that KU is very diverse. I know people from across the country and even some people studying abroad here. Different sexual orientations are common and from what I can tell very accepted.
"The dining hall is pretty good. They are very accomodating for people with allergies, which is a huge plus, but they do not have a big variety of different meal plans for purchase."
"Lots of things to do during the week and of course after Basketball games, Mass Street is rockin."
The Exercise Science program here is great. The professors are extremely intelligent in their respective disciplines and truly care about developing a rapport with the students. A majority of the professors work in research and/or a clinical setting and thus are encouraging students to participate in their own studies and are frequently offering students opportunities to get involved within the department. The courses are appropriately challenging and do a good job to prepare prospective PT/OT school applicants.
It is fairly easy to print when at a campus location. In the dorms they have business labs where i can print to and enter a code for pick up later.
"The process of getting into the Exercise Science program involved taking required general education classes and maintain a particular GPA throughout such classes. Upon completion or during the final semester of these required classes, an electronic application is filled out through the program in the School of Education. The application involved proof of completion in each of these required classes or proof of taking the class during the semester you apply. An additional application with an essay can be fulfilled for scholarship opportunities within the program."
"As an exercise science major an internship is part of my curriculum and must be completed in order to graduate. The internship has requirements such as being unpaid (compensated by receiving college credit), and is typically a 15-week 40hrs/week internship. For my program in particular, the department offers links and contact information to most of the various companies and organizations with which students have interned before and thus I am able to contact them to set up my own. If looking to go anywhere away from campus or out-of-state, there is a minimum GPA and paperwork requirement to fulfill"
Computers are very accessible on campus at coffee shops and libraries and in some rooms
They are amazing they have calendars with activities.
There are a lot of places to park at the dorms but not a lot of places on campus where classes are held. A lot of the houses and apartments have to park off the road. There is no place on campus with free parking during 7am to 5pm and they give out parking tickets really well if you dont have a parking pass.
"There are a lot of restaurants off-campus. All the major chains are close to campus like buffalo wild wings, McD, Dunkin donuts, etc. There are also a lot of asian restaurants and a nice greek restaurant. Its not difficult to find places to eat!"
"The cafeterias inside the dorms are okay. Not the best quality food but decent. There are other on campus places to eat that have chick-fil-a, pizza-hut, sushi, chinese, and other places in a food court under the Wescoe building."
"The financial aid I recieved covered all my tuition but not my living expenses. I am no where close to being a 4.0 student but they still gave me this great scholarship. Living on campus is really expensive and so are books, but KU's financial aid covered a big chunk which I am super grateful for!"
"There are so many options in Lawrence it's ridiculous. It ranges from cheap to extravagant, dirty but delicious to downright gourmet. It's phenomenal."
"When it came to financial aid I'm too ""rich"" to receive any type of grants and my parents didn't want to take out any loans so it sucked because they had to pay for my first year of college by themselves. Their payment plans aren't too beneficial either"
You aren't guaranteed a parking space in the area you want with a parking pass. There are plenty of places to lock up a bike though.
"KU basketball is awesome, and students get really cheap tickets."
I absolutely love the University of Kansas in all aspects of the spectrum
"There are many options when going out to eat, Mass St. is the main source of restaurants around campus"
One of the complexes recently caught on fire so it made me change my view on how off campus housing was
"There are house parties, frat parties if youre in greek life. Lots of bars for 21 and up. The Cave and other clubs have 18 and over nights."
"More Than Good – There are tons of computers to use on campus and campus wifi is almost everywhere. Printing is easy with your KU card and the cost is reasonable, too."
The downtown/campus area of Lawrence is awesome. Everything is so close if you live in that part of town. The local attitude has nothing but love for Lawrence.
"There are plenty of routes and they run on well-timed schedules. Once you're enrolled, all public transportation is free. We also have a program called safe ride. If you need a ride home from the bars, they will come and get you for free as well."
Straight out A. We have an excellent gym. The libraries are also great places to study and on-campus wifi has never failed me. KU has a beautiful campus and Lawrence nightlife has something for everyone.
The weather is crazy some days. In the span of two days it went from 17 degrees to 74 degrees. Other then that the weather is generally fine. It obviously gets cold there but as long as you are prepared for the weather you should be fine.
"As a freshman living in the dorms, the parking sucks. There isn't always room for you to park in front of your dorm so you usually end up parking about three dorms away. They give you tickets for literally everything. If your car is parked on the line, ticket. If you don't fix your car right away they will continue piling on the tickets."
"There are not very many things for underage students to do but there are a few clubs. The down fall of that is they are only 18 and over a few times a week. Other than those select few days it is impossible to get in. The only other option you have is house parties, which are generally pretty fun but can get kind of sketchy at times so you just have to be aware of your surroundings."
"KU has over 600 clubs and organizations that you be a part of, intra-mural sports, $75/semester tutoring for the majority of undergraduate courses, 2 rec centers/2 unions with extended hours, and is just a few minutes walk away from the vibrant downtown known as ""Mass St."" The basketball is unreal, boasting five national titles and I forget how many big XII titles. It has the loudest sports arena in college basketball and is the most historic venue to be at. The atmosphere is contagious and truly is a phenomenol experience to be a part of. Student packages for all home sports games are priced at $150 the past three years so it is easy to get tickets as a student."
"The KU bus system runs all over campus and to all major apartment complexes (and some smaller ones). In addition, students can ride any Lawrence bus for free just by showing their KU ID. And it's included with your campus fees so the cost is minimized. Hertz car rentals are available on campus parked next to the Union and the residence halls. In addition, it is easy to give a friend $20 to take you to the airport in KC."
"Campus is dry so any underage drinking in the residence/scholarship halls is prohibited and grounds for removal. However, typically first offenses are more of a slap-on the wrist. Most other behavior is lenient up to the line where it infringes on others students. I would consider the rules and laws to be reasonable, with very few students complaining."
"Wind can be strong up on the ""hill"" and Kansas winters can be rough but overall, weather is pretty moderate"
"I park at my dorm, so therefore is not an issue with me. There are shuttle buses available all the time which are very helpful."
"It is typical midwest. You have 4 seasons. So far the winter has been mild. The main campus is on top of a hill, so in severe icy weather you want to be careful and give yourself extra time to walk to class."
"I am a member of a sorority. Therefore there are always activities and parties to attend. There are a lot of bars at KU and very easily accessible. There are basketball games as well. There is also a good downtown in Lawrence KS. A lot to do(ie movies,bands etc)"
"The dorms are all pretty good, but the food is bad"
"The dorms are pretty strict, but on campus its easy"
There is a Mac lab and all the others are usually up. You can often find computers in places you would not expect
"Great musical entertainment regularly, cool vintage shopping but not much other activity other than the bars"
Its pretty poor but it is affordable depending on the meal plan you get
Dorms here are better than my other friends dorms but they are still dorms
They don't care about underage if you don't have the drink in your hand
"Lawrence has quite a few options for off campus housing. The cost of rent is a lot higher than what I'm used to though (small Kansas town). There are a lot of complexes that are students only, these tend to be kind of noisy with paper thin walls. But there is always something available, you just have to do your homework and open your eyes."
"The bus schedule while classes are in session is pretty convenient, but if you plan on being in Lawrence over break don't expect the buses to run when or where you might need to catch them. Campus parking in EXTREMELY limited and expensive!!! I chose the Park and Ride option which shuttles you from on off-campus parking lot, but that's still pretty pricey."
"Mass Street is not too far away, but not many restaurants within walking distance."
"The main road through campus that contains all of the most used buildings is blocked off during school hours for school affiliated vehicles only. This makes maneuvering through campus a pain and any other parking around requires a permit. As a city in general, tickets are easy to come by. If you park illegally and leave your car for 5 minutes it is likely that you will be ticketed. A good thing I have to say is Lawrence/KU has a great bus system. I lived 15 minutes south of campus and the school bus came to my apartment complex for pick ups every 30 minutes."
"KU is in a great location. Lawrence, KS is a small town but there is a lot of college feel to it. Many employers around here are specifically looking to employ students so job searching is not always difficult. Our basketball team has always been highly ranked and we have really fun seasons so jayhawk spirit and school games are great to attend. We have a great abroad program that offers opportunities to all majors and all departments. I have received financial aid every semester and they are accommodating to my needs, making it easy for me to attend school even with low funds. Overall, professors are effective are willing to put in their time to help students learn and progress. I will say that I don't like the size of the classes. For gen eds I am usually in a classroom hall that fits 400 but as I get in to core classes for my major the size decrease greatly to 30."
"In my opinion, greek life is beneficial for a certain dynamic of students. I don't think it's meant for everyone and I don't think there should be negative connotation for those who don't participate in it. I think greek life has become something very different from what it originally was intended for. If fraternities and sororities weren't associated so much with partying, gossip, cliques, etc I would be interested in joining one. The process has become way too selective on levels that students shouldn't be judged on."
You hear a lot of stories of drug use and excessive alcohol use.
"There's a ton of variety when it comes to the guys and girls that go to the University of Kansas. No matter what kind of guy or girl you are looking for, you're sure to find them at KU."
"There is a lot going on all the time on the KU campus, no matter what you are interested in. There are hundreds of clubs and intramurals to join and there is something for everyone. Greek life on campus is pretty prevalent but it's not for everyone. KU is a college full of traditions, we even have a ""Traditions Night"" every year at the start of the fall semester. The most popular hangout is Wescoe Beach, especially on sunny spring days."
"Around finals is the prime time that people on campus start to abuse drugs such as Adderral and Ritalin, for the most part at other times no one uses them. However, pot and alcohol are often used during the entire semester. Though KU is supposedly a dry campus, there is often alcohol and pot in the dorms and drunk people are often wandering around the halls of any dorm."
"The libraries and computer labs can be crowded close to finals, but there is usually not a long wait to use a computer. However, one of the best things about the KU technology department is that they are always looking for ways to help the students. For example, near finals, they added extra money to our printing accounts so we could print final projects without worrying about scrounging up the quarters to print ten to fifteen pages of work. Another great thing that they have instituted is phone charging stations. They will be beginning to set up phone charging stations in many computer labs and libraries with iPhone and other phone adapters so that people can charge their phones on campus without having to remember to bring their chargers with them."
"Though sometimes it can be difficult to find an apartment as close to campus as one would like, there is no denying that the prices of Lawrence apartments close to the KU campus is the best."
"""The Legends"" is extremely afforable for people who aren't the richest but don't want to live in the dorms. It's location is almost 5 minutes away from campus and they also have an tight security team who protects the building."
It was very easy and simple for me to get my federal finanical aid but when i came down to the school's finanical aid it was and still is very difficult.
"Univerisity of Kansas has a heart warming welcome to any kind of ethnic background, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation because we are all mature and wise enough to let people express themselves in any way they please and won't feel uncomfortable about it."
When I lived in the dorms I thought the food was very good. Not everything was spectacular but they have tons of options so there is always something good to eat.
"The scholarships that you get at KU are awesome, it is just really hard to get any that are worthwhile..."
The only bad thing about the parking is the cost. It is very expensive and there is no place on campus that you can park for free.
"There are many students at the University of Kansas with different nationalities, religions, and backgrounds. However, the majority of the student body seems to be upper-middle class and white. While the university boasts a large population of study abroad students, a large percentage of those students come from one country (China)."
"There are so many different types of people on campus. There are a lot of international students, especially from Asian countries. All different religions and sexual orientations are present. The political beliefs aren't as diverse, as many people are liberal. The differences among students seem to be easily accepted by others."
There isn't a great parking situation for students at KU. A parking permit for an entire year costs $200 and the only lot that guarantees a spot is by the rec which you either have to walk up the hill or take the bus up to class.
Lawrence has plenty of off-campus housing options. There are places available for any type of housing one can be interested in. The dorms weren't what I was looking for and I was able to find an apartment for the same/less price that is a good quality. There are also specific apartment complexes specifically for students that are cheap and convenient.
"The weather in Kansas can be a little crazy sometimes. It can be sunny one hour and raining the next. Also, we get both hot and cold extremes. I'm used to this as I have lived in Kansas my whole life, but I always check the weather before leaving and I carry a little umbrella just in case."
"I love my major, which is Electrical Engineering. I want to be doing something either with synthesizers and design of said devices, or something with motorsports, and my college has people that specialize in both of those things. My school is pretty good at helping people find jobs after college, and if you don't want a job at one of the companies that the school pretty much feeds into, you have to find your own way into those companies, but you are really well qualified to get into those companies. I'd love to do this all over again, because it's so much fun to learn things!"
"While there has been some criminal activity on campus, it feels pretty safe to go out late at night, simply because you can't go five minutes without seeing a police car pass you. During the day, most people around you are just trying to get to class, just as you are, and there are so many people around, a mugging seems absurd. Plus, there are emergency phones that you can activate, and police will be at your location within two minutes."
"Extra-person charges may apply and vary depending on hotel policy.
Government-issued photo identification and a credit card or cash deposit are required at check-in for incidental charges.
Special requests are subject to availability upon check-in and may incur additional charges. Special requests cannot be guaranteed."
"KU feels like a very safe campus and my experience at Watkins has been excellent. The only time I feel a little iffy is when I'm walking away from my car (which is parked at the Lied Center) to the dorms really late at night, but its really well lit and there's an emergency phone at the edge of the parking lot."
I partied mostly on the weekends and only after I had completed my school work. This way I felt more free while partying and I wasn't really wasting any time.
Mrs. E's loses its luster early in the semester.
I have not really began to dig deep in to the Business Major at KU.
I am currently undergoing transferring majors. It is difficult to understand the requirements for each program. Though explained online; the requirements are not made very clear. The advising center is great for helping students understand what a major or program entails.
"The few times that I've needed to use the computers on campus, I never had a problem finding a spot. The reason I gave a B+ instead of an A is that, as a grad student, there is no printing allowance given as there is to undergrads."
"There are a lot of people on campus at KU. There are a high number of students from Asian countries, especially Japan, so foreign languages aren't rare. There are also a lot of people from Kansas, who haven't looked very far outside of Kansas. Overall, dress is pretty much college chic, with guys in KU apparel and some sort of pants, and girls in KU apparel and leggings. There are some that are more fastidiously dressed, but they are the minority. Guys are tall, and girls are short here. However, as far as interests go, there aren't too many students that are passionate about what they do, unless you go to the schools of music or engineering."
"There are restaurants for everybody near the University of Kansas. The campus is in the heart of down town Lawrence, where ethnicity isn't rare. Walking down Massachusetts street is never a disappointment and no matter what mood you are in you will find a restaurant that will simply ""hit the spot"". There aren't many chain restaurants in the area, which personally is my favorite part. A majority of the restaurants are active in the social network scene, tweeting deals for students daily. Whether you're in the mood for a dollar margarita and some Mexican food at Tapas or a $3 bottle of house wine with italian food at Genovese, you'll find something delicious and affordable for the typical broke college student. There's also a gluten-free fried chicken restaurant which is absolutely scrumptious."
"Lots of options for every interest. Apartments 15 miles away still are 99% students if you want that, or you can live 1 block from campus for the same price in a house. Buses are free and run everyday from all over town so you're pretty much always going to pick a good place. Prices are reasonable, safety is good, and landlords vary."
"With 30,000 students on the Lawrence campus, there's something for everyone"
"After my first semester here, I am very pleased with the variety and effectiveness of their courses. You can go bowling or even do Zumba for college credit. After taking my classes, I feel I have learned a lot without even realizing it."
"The school provides some resources and brochures to look at when searching for a place, but that's as far as they go. I've found apartments simply by doing my own searching and through the talk of friends."
Everyone is able to do as they please without the approval of others. Everyone is welcoming and polite.
"As is typical for Kansas, the weather at KU can be a little unpredictable and ever changing at times. For the most part, however, it's never too extreme, and in the case of bad weather there are buses constantly coming to and from campus."
"Compared to the rest of Kansas, KU (and Lawrence itself) is a haven for interesting people. You'll find guys and girls from all walks of life, and a lot of them attractive. There are people from all subcultures, if that's what you're into, and it'll be no challenge finding somewhere you fit in."
"I have never felt unsafe on campus. It is very beautiful, safe place to be. I would keep the door locked at night because of pranks but that will be over before you know it."
"The nightlife at the University of Kansas is pretty big. The only problem is that you have to be 21yrs or older to enter most of the bars and clubs. There are a couple of places that are available for 18yr olds and these are enjoyable places to go to. The transportation at KU is pretty remarkable. They have ""safe buses"" that are available for students who have had too much to drink and these run almost all night long on the weekends. The parties across the campus are pretty hard to miss. Almost every fraternity throws a party on the weekends and the houses around the campus are always throwing lawn parties."
"The Greek Life at the University of Kansas is pretty big. Being in a fraternity myself, I see the Greek Life as a mainly positive influence on the campus. Every other week, I see some fraternity or sorority sponsoring some sort of fundraiser for cancer patients or for the St. Jude's Hospital. In my fraternity, each active or pledge is required to get a certain amount of community service hours each semester in order to stay in the house. So all in all, the Greek Life may get the bad rap for all of its crazy parties and the wild stories you hear, but if you care to take a deeper look at the system, you will be surprised at what you see."
"The diversity at Kansas is unreal. After my first semester at the University of Kansas, I have seen and experienced things that I had never seen before. I came from a private high school in Wichita and so I lived a pretty sheltered life. But this diversity that I have experienced was not always bad. I became friends with students from China. I have been challenged in my beliefs and moral values and I enjoy a good argument. Finally, the University of Kansas has opened me up to more of what the world believes in and what the world expects of me."
"Initial scholarships are really easy to apply for at KU; it's practically formulaic. You just punch in your ACT/SAT scores and GPA and you automatically qualify for a scholarship based on a tier system. They offer some really attractive renewable four year scholarship and just overhauled the system, enabling them to give more people money. Beyond that, it becomes a little confusing. The online system is a hassle to navigate and a single scholarship can be broken down into different chunks, making it appear like a different one. There are plenty of opportunities, you just have to go a little out of your way to find them."
KU is great at providing a healthy campus. There are campus police and security ready available. There are lights and emergency phones all throughout campus. I always feel safe walking home alone.
"The drug scene at KU isn't very noticeable on campus. It really depends on the groups that a person hangs out with. I have a few different groups of friends. Most don't take part in drugs. There are a few cliques though that revolve around drug use, unfortunately."
"KU overall is a very safe campus. If you use common sense (not walking alone in the middle of the night, keeping an eye on your surroundings) then you would be golden. There have been a few instances of campus crime (robbery more than anything) but you can always call the campus cops either from your cell phone or from one of the call boxes on campus. I have never felt in danger on campus."
"Lawrence is a vibrant college town. There are things to do no matter what you like. Like clubbing? Mass St. is your place - there are a ton of good bars. Like cultural activities? There are group performances, holiday activities (like sugar skull decorating for Dia de los Muertos), exhibits, and more. While there aren't very many chain stores in Lawrence, the town boasts tons of local shops for everything from sports apparel to instruments to clothing."
"It is very strict, but very necessary. I wouldn't change it."
"The people in Lawrence Kansas are very friendly. I've yet to see any fight, and or any reason for the police in KU. If your studying all night and come out the library you find this crowd of helpful people that will assist you if needed to walk you home. There is a very secure and safe system setup at KU."
"There really isn't anything on the school its self, but maybe stashed away in the dorms."
We have a well-kept gym. If you wanted to take a class most of all the classes are $3 a class. If you are a student you can get in for free. It is open pretty late on most days it closes at 10 pm. We have four libraries and they stay open till about 1 am but on finals week they stay open till 3 am. If you don't want to study in your room the library is the best alternative. In each of the library there are different places for group study and individual study.
If you are going to class the only option you really have is takeing the bus which is free if you are a student around campus. Those buses usually run from about 7am-9pm on M-thur. but stop at 6pm on friday but if you have to be somewhere and it is on a gameday it's best that you walk there the buses usually run REALLY slow.
"I gave it University of Kansas an A is because it is really safe there. We have the SafeBus(buses) which runs from Thurs-sat. from 9pm-2am and SafeRide(sort of like a taxi company) which runs from 9pm-3am,which are both free get kids home safely after for example a party home."
Alcohol is far more visible than drugs at KU. I see and here very little about drugs. Alcohol is more prevalent and there are a number of bars around campus that many students go to. Overall I would say there is little pressure from peers and policies are enforced pretty strictly.
Off campus housing is very good. There are tons of fraternities and sororities for those interested in greak life. The price is a little higher but the friendships that are made can be well worth it. There are hundreds of houses made for college students. Many of these houses fit anywhere from 6-15 people and can be a lot of fun. Parking can be somewhat of a challenge as most parking lots don't hold as many as they should. The houses are very safe and overall I think off campus housing is a great idea.
"Football at the University of Kansas has been terrible over the past few years, but people still really enjoy gamedays on Saturdays. The turnout at football games is average but not great. Basketball is huge at KU and everyone loves going to the game. There are many great traditions for athletics and KU is a fun place to be."
"Computers are always available at the libraries, I typically bring my own laptop though. Wireless can sometimes be slow, but printing is great because they provide you with $8.00 which is hard to exceed."
"There are several options for living off-campus. Apartments, houses, greek life houses. Call around and you can find several different prices and availability. I hear that the Connection and Legends can be pretty pricey, but they are both super nice. Just far from campus!"
"Variety of nightlife places to go! And safebuses are helpful, just not timely."
The university is fairly key on enforcing drug policies on campus.
"There are plenty of available computers through the computer labs and the libraries. Connection might not always be optimal, but it is a rather large campus."
"The dorms are not horrible, some in better conditions than others. There are plenty of nearby off-campus housing apartments in the area at affordable prices. The campus is on a hill though, so no matter where you are, you will eventually face walking a steep hill for classes."
"At the University of Kansas, you are very challenged. The classes are hard and very large, especially the introduction to chemistry and biology classes. Be prepared to teach yourself several of the lessons. Studying is absolutely mandatory! There are plenty of resources to go to such as the learning centers and TAs available to you. Attending lecture is always a great way to maintain coherence of a subject. I am currently getting ready to apply to the Biology program. I still have one more pre-req to be completed before I can apply. The advisors are very helpful and I highly recommend seeing an advisor at least once a semester to keep you on track. My work load is always very full so I will only work on weekends once the Spring 2013 semester begins."
"As a freshman, I lived in both GSP and Oliver. My first semester, I lived in GSP, the all girls dorm. It was a really great place. The girls were extremely friendly. However, since I have lived there, they have newly remodeled the dorm, so I'm sure it is even better! Oliver wasn't the best experience. The hot water wasn't always working, so I had to take cold showers sometimes in January and February. It was not fun."
"Lawrence has a wide range of apartments and duplexes available to students! I found a duplex, that I share with three other people, and I only pay about $300 per month, and that is including utilities with cable and internet! Housing is very abundant in Lawrence and the city is still expanding!"
There are numerous computers available throughout the campus. Locations include libraries and other on-campus buildings. Speed of the WIFI could improve.
"For the most part the guys are pretty outgoing at the University of Kansas. There are a lot of fraternities, so sometimes they get a little overwhelming. The girls are really sweet too. Again, there are a lot of sororities so they too can get a little overwhelming sometimes. Altogether, very lovely atmosphere!"
DO NOT STAY IN MCCOLLUM!!!!!!!!!!!! IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!
"I don't have a car, so I can't really tell you much. I heard that parking is expensive though."
The Lawrence and Med Center campuses provide great facilities for students. Everything is clean. Both campuses should focus on becoming more wheelchair accessible for all students to enjoy facilities.
Parking is expensive. I usually park on the street for free and walk to class.
The Lawrence and Med Center have lots of different organizations for any student to join. There's plenty of cultural events and activities in close proximity. The restaurants in Lawrence and KCK are delicious!
"Kansas weather can be wild, so make sure you check the weather before you get dressed in the morning. This week started with temperatures in the 60s and now it's 20 degrees outside. I kind of love experiencing all the seasons, though. If you get too uncomfortable, just hop on a campus bus."
There are many computer labs on campus. All computers are equipped with a lot of fun and useful programs.
"As it is a big University, there are a lot of people who do drugs. Thankfully, everyone is really cool, and if you refuse no one will pressure you into anything."
"There are SO many yummy, cheap places to eat around campus. Mass Street especially has TONS of options which some are even open late after the bars close so you can get a cheap late night snack!"
Everyone is really nice and there are many various groups in which you can easily find one that you click with.
"The food is overall good. The dining hall on Daisy Hill is pretty hit or miss, but the Underground on campus is better! It can be pretty congested, and it could probably be better organized, along with better seating to accommodate more people."
"All of the dining halls on campus offer something different. Mrs. E's is the mother of all dining halls. The Underground has good food. It has a lot of options including chic-fil-a. The union has a ton of options as well. If u don't branch out and try new things, it can get old. But if you keep it interesting you shouldn't have any problems."
I love the free bus system for all students that runs on campus and all throughout the city. The buses stay on schedule for the most part and the buses are nice. The buses start running early in the morning before classes and don't stop running till really late at night. There are even bus routes called Safe Ride that run till early in the morning for the partiers.
"Tons of parties, bars, and things to do on mass street!"
"Cops dont care if you are drinking, just DONT HAVE ANY ON YOU. they will give you a minor in posession if you get caught with it outside of a party. other than that, its lenient."
"Great environment, lots of fun and great place to grow"
"going to court for having 2 people over. ""noise"""
I don't feel as though drugs are a major problem at KU. But students are required to take an online alcohol EDU class and I think that policies on drugs and alcohol are definitely enforced.
I was undecided when first coming to KU. And I'm very glad that so many different majors are offered here. I got a lot of help from my counselor in choosing a major and looking at different programs. I am now on a path to do pre dentistry and am majoring in biology.
"Food on campus at places like the Underground and the Studio are very good. However, the food at Mrs. E's is steadily sub par at best. The food is either over or undercooked, vegetables are not fresh and are soggy, and overall, food is just bland."
I am from Maryland and came all the way to Kansas simply because I am in love with the school. They have so many options of majors to choose from and the campus is gorgeous. People are so friendly and classes so far have been fun yet challenging.
There are many places to dine and they offer many discounts to KU students.
Financial Aid is decent I do recommend that they offer more scholarship programs for students.
It is your typical Kansas weather you just never really know!
"Student life at KU is amazing. The facilities are great. The recreation center (the rec) is very nice and big and has everything you can think of to get a good workout in. The underground is a nice big cafe area where you can meet up with friends between classes or if it is nice out there is plenty of room to sit outside. Traditions at KU are so important. Especially if they have to do with basketball, KU is the birth place of basketball. Game days at KU are so much fun! Campus life is what makes KU feel like home."
"There are a lot of different kinds of guys at KU. Even if you are picky about what kind of guys you like you can kind that at KU. There are guys from all over the country that come to KU. You have frat guys, athletes, nerdy guys, really funny ones. Most of them are really nice. Very attractive too."
Most of the professors are very good and helpful. They really try to help students and have available office hours you can attend. There are a lot of tutors you can get for many different subjects. There are a lot of libraries on campus to study in.
Lawrence is a great town! It may be small but there is so much to do. Mass street has many cute shops and restaurants. Facilities at KU are really nice. Sports life at KU are crazy! Allen Field house is the loudest gym in the country and games are so much fun to attend.
Being a nursing major at the University of Kansas is great! There is a pre-nursing group where you can meet other nursing majors.
"Mass is a great place to hang out and there is plenty to do! You will never get bored with the amazing concerts of indie bands to local bands, and Kansas city isn't far either."
There are a variety of options for practically any type of food that you want!
"Drugs are used by most students, though, it is not openly used."
"Campus Housing can be very expensive, but is a great way to meet new people and to get involved!"
Our dining options are pretty awesome. The dorms have places to each which are buffet style and the food is usually pretty good. There are a couple of coffee shops in the union as well as a little quick stop stop for random things. everything is decent priced. There is also a floor with different food options such as Pizza Hut and a sandwich shop in one of our buildings.
"Everyone that I know who has lived in on eof the dorms has really enjoyed it. In fact, a few of them even became RAs so they could stay in the dorms!"
I am a psychology student and I love it. I have awesome teachers who do their best to help and are always there to give extra help when needed.
It is just like any other town really. A number of fast food chains everywhere and some really good places like the Salty Iguana.
"I have never had an experience with anybody using drugs here and neither has anyone I know, however, it is a college town so there is use here just like everywhere else. And you have to try and avoid some areas just to be save."
Very strict on certain issues like sexual harassment and drunken driving
No financial aid offered to international students
The community is very friendly especially to international students like myself
It's good but not as diverse and the nearby Kansas City night life.
"There are loads of libraries, some even have specific reason. There's an engineering library, and a music library. There are lots of places to hang out, and many traditions that students can get involved in."
"I absolutely love Lawrence. The town is just the right size to not get lost, but still have a lot of stuff to do. There are many restaurants and stores on Mass Street, there's a farmer's market, and the people are so friendly. I love it."
"Parking on campus can quickly diminish because of the many people who live off campus. I use the Park and Ride. I park in a parking lot away from campus, and take a five minute bus ride to campus. It's cheaper, and there are always spots, no matter what time you get there."
"I am a mathematics and computer science major. The engineering department is decent. There are some bad teachers/classes and little support when it comes to getting into the classes you need, but overall it isn't too bad. As for the Mathematics department, it is horrible for undergrads; very little help, involvement, and opportunities to get involved with your choice of major."
"I'm in the School of Engineering and since day one I've felt the welcoming factor from being in the engineering program. It may not it the top of the list for some majors, but the professors still expect the top work. There are many challenges that the school has for standards of the students, but they are possible to be achieved with some hard work. It's college after all."
"Lawrence is a medium urban town. There is always something to do whether it be going to the gym, being outside, seeing a concert, or hanging out. The people are nice and have the love for the university all throughout the town."
"There are many healthy options on campus for those with specific needs. The campus has much variety, however there are not a bunch of dining halls around campus and stores in every building. The majority of them close pretty early, dining halls around 7-730 and some others around 5-530, so students have to make sure to eat before then because of the limited amount of time. Meal plans are good for the first year and if you are living in a dorm, however not necessary for the rest of your time at KU."
"The school runs a shuttle service day and night and on the weekends. The schedule is easy to fllow and runs throughout the town of Lawrence. Plus, it is free to the students!!"
The greeks are very involved in social events on the campus and add too the college experience.
There are a number of dining halls on campus. There is tremendous variety in food choices.
"They are all new and work well, the printer system is great"
"The town isn't large, so using your own car can really waste time and bog down traffic. Public transportation is free for students, on campus it is exemplary and off campus is pretty manageable. There is also saferide and safebus for weekends and long nights."
"Non-Greeks look down upon the Greeks and I'm sure it's vice versa. They seem more outlandish here than other colleges and are made fun of as ""frat-tastic"" and ""sorostitutes"" or ""so-ho's"" as they seem trashy and full of themselves. I'm sure there is a good networking built up and the social possibilities are probably beneficial if you can keep your partying under control."
"Drugs aren't that big on campus. They also have an online course you have to take about Drug Safety. There are drugs present, but in small groups."
"Dining halls are okay, ratings go: North College Cafe (GSP/Corbin), Mrs. E's (Daisy Hill), and Oliver Dining Hall (Oliver). Options are available each day and have quite a variety of items to choose from."
"The classes are all unique and interesting. The Department of Architecture, Design, and Planning is very well-rounded and helps all of its students get ready for not only classes, but the future as well. Campus is large and has lots of clubs and organizations to be a part of. Great school."
"If it's basketball......all out A+
Other sports, not so much. but still supported pretty well."
"Our campus is very diverse. We have many different religions as well as races. They definitely comprise a good percentage of the student body. However, they do not intermingle very much. Many of the ethnic or religious groups band together."
"There are a lot of options for off campus housing that are close to campus. However, many of the options are expensive. Greek is probably the way to go when it comes to off campus housing. These are the most affordable living arrangements, as well as close to campus."
"The food is good, but very repetitive. A greater variety and healthier choices would really be better."
I am getting my degree in psychology and then I plan on going to nursing school. I love the path i am taking and I'm really excited to go to KU nursing school.
"Kansas weather is crazy. It changes a lot and can be totally random. When its nice its really nice but when its nasty it's really nasty. Most of the time the weather is pretty nice but it can be really windy, most of the time."
"The process of getting in to the Psych program is fairly easy. You only have to take a few pre-requisit classes to apply and have a decent GPA. IT doesn't take that much time, and all the classes are really interesting."
So far right now its only rained. But the school does offer buses for people that would have to walk a long way to their classes.
"Nice college town. The local residents and business owners treat students very well. It's definitely a college sports town. The KU Jawhawks are tops in this town and supported throughout the US, and are even well known abroad, not just in Lawrence or Kansas. It's a safe and nice place to live, work and go to school. Many of my friends live here!"
I'm an English Major and I'm very pleased with my education thus far. The workload in all of the classes is fair. I enjoy the professor/student interactive teaching style that my instructors use. The curriculum is kept current with the changes and the facilites are well maintained and anesthetically pleasing to the eye. Internship/job opportunities are readily available for just about anything one might be interested it. They do make it possible for a student to get hands on learning in a job setting.
The KU Police are very visable and available to provide escorts for students back to their dorms when unable to park in their cars in dorm lots and must park on the street. They're always available to provide assistance to the needs of the students. They're are cameras which are on and watched by KU Police dispatchers. They also provide a good response time when called.
"I love the psychology department and the applied behavioral science department. Between the advisors and the professors, you can get help and/or answers quickly and efficiently without feeling like you are bothering someone or taking up too much of their time. They want to help and you can feel it."
"plenty of buses going in every direction. Off campus parking is cheaper and the buses are clean and friendly, on-time and abundant. Whether needing to go to WalMart or just to the other end of Jayhawk, it is awesome!"
A lot of fun people and professors. Many opportunities to help with research in a wide variety of areas. The psychology advisor is a wonderful person who is always willing to take time with you to answer even the smallest questions with a smile.
"Most of the professors are super great and love the subject they are teaching and love the art of teaching. Most professors want their students to learn and do well and succeed. Occasionally, a grad student gets stuck in and is not quite up to par, but, I suppose everyone starts somewhere. Sometimes, I wish we got a tuition break while they break in the newbies though."
"The anthropology department is incredible. By its very nature, the department is interdisciplinary and inclusive of objective and subjective methodologies. Such a variety of interesting courses and influential worldviews presented over the course of each semester."
"Tons of music venues and art locales. The bus shuttle system provides a 'Safe-ride"" transportive route to help move the populace about safely on drunken evenings."
"There are a variety of places to grab meals on campus, usually each library and student union has a place to purchase food. However, it is difficult to find a spot on campus to feed yourself after 6pm unless you are willing to settle for the gas station menu equivalent. Not very many vegaitarian options."
Lawrence is a diamond in the rough when it comes to kansas. In the non-diverse sea that is kansas lawrence is a pocket filled with diversity. The community is extremely accepting of everyone.
"Lawrence is a lot of fun, there's always stuff to do, great concerts, good food and nice people. Also there's no traffic and its a safe place as well."
"There are numerous types of resturants. We have good ole American, Thai food, Chinese, Mexican, Indian etc. We have the fast food resturants that everyone loves. And we are not too far from Kansas City and Topeka where the options are more plentiful."
"Just like any school, the diversity is everywhere. We have all different types of men and women. From different countries, different races, different religions, and different sexualities."
There are houses/apartments all over Lawrence. That the students can live in for relatively cheap. And have great transportation to the university.
The compter labs are easy to use. However they are slow and million of people always on them so hard to get a turn on them.
the social life at KU is hard due to so many people are in there own world and really not open to new poeple. It super hard to make friends when you are the quit one and have a large class and so many people around that have there own groups. it sad
"Many places for a mix of talents, sexual preferences (LGBT), student groups regarding religion, advocacy and ally groups for mental health and physical disabilities."
"In the world of acadamia, any program or policy that is not conducive to a learning environment is stamped out by administration. However there is a lot of choices about what is considered learning. There really is no Taboo subjects."
In passing I have heard conversations about class size and instructor availability that may have adverse effects on a students grades.
There is an amazing variety of restaurants on our downtown strip (Mass. Street) and since it's a college town they're very affordable. You'll always find coupons and deals as a student for off-campus food.
This is a college town so finding a sublease or an apartment is going to be easy but not necessarily cheap on your budget. Find housing and get it set up as soon as possible or you might miss out on some major deals.
"Bars are all over town, and to be honest you don't have to be 21, it's beyond easy to get into a bar with a fake. That said I know students who've gotten in trouble and if you go in and talk with people they will lower the charges. With quite the student ghetto house parties are abundant."
There are a lot of options for all different kinds of preferences.
The drug prevelance at the University of Kansas is apparent if you seek it out; however it is not something you would encounter on a daily or even weekly basis if you avoid it.
"The drug scene at KU is mostly smoking. I have never seen elicit drug use. I think that alcohol use is more prevalent here, but not mainly on campus. If you go off campus into the restaurants and pubs and such you will see more alcohol use then drug use. In fact I am not bothered by the drug scene here at all. As far as peer pressure goes, I have never been asked to use any drugs."
"The work load seems to fit a graduate program. In fact I was pleased with everything. The only reason that I am giving an A- score is because I applied to the graduate program from my home in Idaho Falls Idaho. I found out that i got accepted into the program only three weeks before orientation was. That was a short time for me to apply for student loans, find housing, pack my whole family up and move all the way to Kansas. It was really stressful and my wife and I wished that we had had more time."
"As a grad student in the business school, I expect the work load to be advanced, which it is. The program is uniquely organized two build on the experiences I have already accumulated in the workforce. The courses that I am enrolled in are testing my knowledge, and strengthening experiences with knowledge and theoretic knowledge that teach how to make the best of everyday circumstances, and lead effectively. This program has a great following, so internships are are almost limitless. The facilities are specifically designed to meet the needs of my peers and self. Just recently we traveled to Ashland Kansas to practice business consulting. This is great because it is putting me in a real world setting with real situations that I would be dealing with in my job after I graduate. I am pleased that I got into this MBA program and I am looking forward to next semester."
"There are computer labs all over the place, sometimes you just have to look for them. The computers and network speed are tip top. There are quick-printing locations in all the libraries on campus for your quick-use needs. There is great wi-fi service if you bring your laptop to school. If you don't have your own laptop or forget yours, you can rent one from Anchutz library!"
"I came to KU to pursue the Environmental Studies program, it is one of the oldest in the nation! KU also has a great architecture program, many of my friends are in it. If you live in Missouri and want to pursue architecture, you can get in-state tuition!"
"Corbin = Sorority Girls

GSP = Sorority Girls/Weed Smoking Guys...it's a weird mix

Hashinger = Pot Dorm"
"If you aren't in a sorority or fraternity, your social life at KU is pretty limited your freshman year. If you are not greek, the greeks will not talk to you or treat you as an ""equal."" Try to join other clubs and organizations to meet more people that are not a part of the Greek system."
"It's so hard to get into the Education Program at KU. They are way too picky and don't accept people that they should. They look for GPA which is strange, they should look for experience. The process is normal. Just try hard and have a good GPA."
"I am relatively happy with the Education Program. I want to teach kindergarten, but I dislike how picky they are about the applicants for the program. I am concerned I won't get it, because they are so picky about who they take. I feel like you don't need the best GPA to be a teacher. I have had teacher's that barely made it in college and they were the best teachers I have ever had. I have also had teacher's that had straight A's at private schools and they were the worse teachers I have ever had. It goes both ways and it's unfair to take someone because they had a rough semester."
"I will be student teaching in a few years, which will be an internship. We are unpaid, but we put a lot of time and effort into making lesson plans for the week. It's a lot of work, but it's completely worth it."
"I believe that KU well prepares students for life after their degree. My major in the Biological Sciences has a pretty heavy workload, but it is manageable with the right skills that will be needed for Medical School. The facilities are above average and many opportunities are available."
"The prices are very high for places off campus but within walking distance, and you don't receive a good quality for the price you would pay. Most apartments close to campus are unfurnished, adding extra expenses, and those farther away lose the luxury of closeness. However, there are many options for off-campus living and apartment communities are safe and convenient, most with bus routes that regularly go to campus."
"Most classes are very large, and registering for classes for the first time can be very stressful. However, there are many libraries with various hours, and one is open all night most nights of the week. The AAAC offers tutoring opportunities and the quality of the classes is admirable."
"There is a wide variety of people on campus from international students to people from all over the US. I've met people with widely different beliefs, orientations, and economic backgrounds, and overall people here are very tolerant of differences."
"Get it done as soon as possible, don't dilly dally at all or you could be missing out on scholarship money. My parents wouldn't get their tax information for the FASFA to me in time and it really cost me alot."
I'd say it's about average for a Midwest college. Most people are white and the rest are a minority but I haven't seen much intolerance of any ethnicity.
KU sits on a large hill which can make it treacherous when it snows. But there is a very good bus route all around town if you have to walk a ways.
pledge life is like so awesome. we all have our own houses in our own little community
Not enough student parking. We have less parking but we seem to keep expanding in the buildings.
My school does a wonderful job of getting minorities to join research programs by allowing them many options
"One second it would be hot and sunny, the next it's windy, cold and rainy. The weather is really bi-polar and it doesn't help that the campus is on top of Mt. Oread. When the weather is nice, almost everyone is outside."
"The computer labs at KU are all very up-to-date and useful. They recently just updated their wi-fi services so if you have a laptop and are a student, you get free unlimited wi-fi on campus! Even if you didn't have a laptop, there's so many available computers around campus that would be easy to find."
"There are a lot of places to go. Dining halls within the dorms, the Union, or the Underground. The dining halls are just what you would expect - cafeteria food. Some of the meals are excellent, but some are below average. The union has a small variety of food and there are daily deals to save your money. The Underground has great food, even a Chick-fil-A, but is usually pretty busy."
"Above Average – Everything is within walking distance, so getting a good parking spot isn't really a big deal. There are plenty of lots around campus, and the permit system is very good. My only complaint with parking is the high price, but what can you expect from a University? All they want is your money."
"Not a Big Deal – Nobody really cares if you're involved in Greek life or not. There's so much diversity at KU that everyone fits into their own mold and nobody really judges anybody else based on their activities and involvements. The frat parties are entertaining and anyone can go, but nobody cares if you're not actually Greek."
Pretty Strict – I don't believe that there's much tolerance for underage drinking or drugs.
Everything is pretty straight forward and the teachers are helpful.
"It's a pleasant campus, couldn't ask for much more. Parking sometimes sucks, but other than that, A+"
"University of Kansas is nationally ranked in a ton of programs. Here you can study to be an astronaut, take courses in pre med, or even be a psychiatrist. Your dreams start here, tradition lives here."
"A Variety Is Key to Sucess – KU has everything. A Variety of cultures from all over the world and it just doesn't stop there. A very opinionated school has gays, and lesbians and anything else you can think of! KU is just a place to feel at home."
"Parking on campus is somewhat not needed with the bus routes that continuously move around the campus. Every building is in a nice walking distance from each other, and the campus is too beautiful to drive around anyway (:"
"Absolutley Amazing Bus Drivers! The bus drivers here at KU are amazing at getting you to where you need to go on time, and if you accidentally miss the bus and are crunched for time, there is always a bus right behind that one ready to pick you up. The bus routes are easy to read, and guess what. It's absolutely FREE to ride any bus with your KU ID."
"Process Went Pretty Good. Tips are starting fast because KU offers so much, and deadlines are quick and they give out to the quickest. KU Is a very great school to attend with a beautiful campus and very great people."
All You Can Eat – Seriously all you can eat. Everywhere around town from the newer parts to Mass street--there are TONS of options and ethnicities to choose from. Tiny mom & pop shops to chains
"Fun for All – Nightlife at KU is awesome. On campus is dry, but if you go to the greek houses for house parties or down to Mass street, you'll have a ton of fun. Try the Oread hotel--a few different bars in there are fun. Sandbar is best for goofy fun."
"KU is a very seemingly safe campus. I haven't had any issues, ever, nor have I felt scared to walk alone even at midnight"
"Variety on Mass. Massachusetts Street in Lawrence, Kansas is undeniably the town hot-spot. It offers various restaurants, bakeries, and dessert shops that can fit most dietary needs. Vegan and vegetarian options are easy to find. With Brazilian, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian and Greek menus, the wide variety of eateries can suit any mood."
"Greeks are known to party. But I've noticed the Greeks at KU do a lot of community service projects as well. The white, black, and Latino organizations also work together. It's not as hokey as you are in the movies."
"You Name It, You'll See It – Yes, the state of Kansas is predominantly white. However, Lawrence is one of those pocketed areas with ethnic, religious, and political diversity. I have seen and heard from several ethnic and religious cultures from around the world, both on and off campus. And there are many interest groups on campus devoted to ethnic diversity. I join them to learn about different customs, make new friends, and eat good food! Not only does it enhance my education, but I'm learning to be a world citizen. No matter when I go after college, I'll have been exposed to people from places all over the world - right here in Kansas!"
"Eclectic and Close to KC – Lawrence is growing bigger and offers a variety of things to do, both on and off campus. They residents are are friendly and welcoming. Kansas City is a much larger city about 30 minutes away. Both the Kansas and Missouri sides of KC offer fun, food, and friendliness. That's a the closest airport, train station, and they have MegaBus as well. I feel safe in Lawrence and for the most part of KC. I also think they are both great places to live after graduation and if you want to raise a family."
"School of Social Welfare – I feel I'm getting the best education in my area. In fact, the school ranks 9th in the nation for social work! I get a generalist education, and I can then choose a clinical or administrative path in the last part of my curriculum. You can go for one year in the master's program, provided your bachelor's degree is in social work. Or if you're changing careers, like I am, you can go part-time...up to four years! Again, everyone is there to help you succeed. The grad assistants are wonderful and the professors are awesome to get to know, answer questions, give advice, and encourage and motivate. There are offering in Lawrence, Kansas City, and Overland Park. And if you live in the KC metro area on the Missouri side, you may qualify for a discount on tuition, which helped me tremendously."
"Something for Everyone – Not only does KU have the majors, departments, and degree offerings that most colleges have, they also have some unique minors and certification programs to enhance your degree. There are almost a hundred class offerings that I was amazed they could offer credit for (ethnic studies, cultural types, religious ideology.) They also offer a general studies degree so if you're truly undecided, you can dabble in just about everything and still walk away with a degree. The professors know their subjects, and they are approachable. They also have great study tips and tutoring help, should you need it. It seems like everyone is wanting you to graduate and succeed, and they will help you along he way - which is rare that a 4-year university as large as KU can do!"
"There's Lots of Variety – There are several dining halls on campus. In the student union, there are several popular chain fast food options. And in town, not far from campus, there are lots of places, local, regionally, and nationally known, that serve a variety of ethnic and alternative-diet meals. There's something for everyone!"
"Extreme Craziness – Summers are normally hot, but this summer was brutal! Winters can be really cold and windy with some snow, but mainly ice. Fall and spring are pretty; however, they can get a bad storm popping up and tornado warnings at any time."
"These Buses Go EVERYWHERE – The University of Kansas has a bus system that seems to span the entirety of Lawrence. All buses that go from dorms to the actually Halls circulate about every 6 minutes! This is good news because that means if you miss your bus another one should be right behind it! The buses also go down to the downtown or across town to the out of campus apartments. At night the ""SafeBus"" starts up and gets people safely around to where they need to be in order to avoid drinking and driving or walking home alone in the dark. There is also a ""SafeRide"" which will come pick you up like a free taxi cab during the night to avoid the same dangers."
"Why Is Everyone So Good-Looking?? Pretty much everywhere you turn here on the University of Kansas Campus there is going to be someone attractive. It seems like all the girls are pretty, and all in different ways. Here we have the artsy types, the athletic types, the sorority types, the modest types, the nerdy types, any sort of girl you can think of is here and she is 8 times out of 10 going to be gorgeous, which can be a little disheartening sometimes. As for the guys, they range from average to way above average and also cover the whole spectrum of nerdy to frat to athletic and beyond!"
"They Mean It When They Say, ""You Belong Here&quot – The University of Kansas postcard that many potential students receive says, ""you belong here"", and they definitely aren't kidding! There are so many different things to study, places to go, and people to hang out with that no matter who you are you really CAN feel like you belong. The town is great, the campus is beautiful, the classes are insightful, and there is so much to do!"
"In every single class I have ever been in there is a pretty even amount of each race, religion, sexual orientation, etc."
There has never been a time where I have been walking around campus and felt unsafe for any reason. Campus police are really nice and the campus has services available to pick you up from lets say the library late at night and drive you home so you don't have to walk in the dark.
Above and Beyond – The school actually created an office (Office of Multicultural Affairs) to lead the way in school diversity. They have done a great job
"Find Your Own Way – So I'm one of those people that like EVERYTHING, thus choosing one thing to major in was extremely difficult. While the university does do a good job of guiding you along your chosen major, and even being actively involved with you in SOME majors, they dont do a great job of helping you choose A major. People in the undecided field feel like their being pressured into finding a major and when I was semi-undecided, they encouraged me to drop different classes and stay on the career track because ""I might like it in the end"". Bottom line, I had to go to a completely different school over the summer to figure our what I wanted to do."
"The Liberal Experience – Kansas has been notorious for being a conservative state, but once you step onto the Lawrence campus, you seem to be entering almost a whole new world. The social scene is always live, and if your not careful you will start to live for the parties, which can get out of hand sometimes. Lawrence caters to every personality type: the nerds have quid-ditch, the jocks of course have state of the art training facilities, artsy people have Spencer Art Museum and their creations displayed around the city, etc. The academics: the professors really want you to visit during office hours, they try to make jokes and have class seem lively and fun instead of a chore"
"The Old and the New – I love how my school has all these new and entertaining things going on in the new/ renovated building, but step in one of the older building and it feels as if you were transported way back in time. Especially in the dorms. Those should have been renovated first because you can tell some were built in the fifties."
"Lawrence: the Ideal College Town – The title says it all. With so many unique local restaurants, cool places to shop, fun hang-outs, and active bars/clubs... Lawrence is exactly where you want to live as a college student! Be sure to check out the Java Break off Mass Street if you like coffee, or Abe & Jake's for a hopping nightlife. Really, Lawrence offers something to everybody."
"Avoid the ""Student Ghetto""! In southeast Lawrence, there is a moderate span of apartments and rental houses known as the ""student ghetto"" - sure, they're cheap, but be prepared to deal with bad plumbing, absent landlords, and zero deposit returns! It's worth it to splurge on a nicer place like The Reserve, The Legends, or Campus Court. The Park & Ride is a fantastic system, so if you want to live further away from campus, that's also a good option to look into."
Here Is Like Melting Pot. So many international students are in Lawrence. and Many organization really support them. I like it
"Bus System Is Very Good – Bus system is very good. It is free for KU student.
and even It run break time."
Hot & Cold – Kansas weather is always unpredictable. It pretty much gets really cold in the winter and really hot in the summer. Fall and spring are nice!
"Ease and Affordability – I have lived off campus now for two years at two different locations. My first place was a little farther from campus, but it was still only about an 8 minute drive. It was very easy to get an apartment there. They have many amenities and it was very nice. Most complexs off campus have a bus route that goes directly to campus and it is free for students. The cost was affordable, but not the cheapest there is."
"Little Big Town – Lawrence has all the ingredients of a big city. Attractions, interesting hot spots, concerts, venues, diversity, and people. All of that is wrapped up in a city that is not too huge. It's perfect. There is always something to do either with the university or outside it. There are concerts going almost every day. The downtown (aka Mass. street) is a great place to be. It has great food, live entertainment, and good people. Musicians play in the street and after a big game, it is definitely the place to be."
"Computer Availablity – They have a ton of computers in both libraries, and have printers. You get $8 worth of printing at the beginning of each semester. ($0.8 per page). You can also rent laptops if needed. Most every student has thier own laptop and they have wireless everywhere on campus."
"KU basically only has on campus housing for freshman. There is one set of apartments for upperclassmen but are expremely hard to get into because it houses mostly athletes. There are close to campus apartments which are nice but also kind of hard to get into. Have to apply really early. Living on Daisy Hill as a freshman is the best option because most live there, and it is social. Most upperclassmen live in houses that are close to campus"
"School Spirit – KU has insane amounts of school spirit! Everyone in Lawrence is always wearing KU stuff, and the basketball games are a HUGE deal and so much fun."
"Exercise Science Program – This program has good professors and smaller classes which is nice. They also have a ton of labs and studies that you can participate in and volunteer for which is good to put on a resume for graduate school (PA, PT, etc). Emphasis on the sciences which are hard but managable. You have one semester that is purely an internship which is nice."
Frat Guys – KU is big on greek life and a lot of the boys you meet out are in a fraternity. Some are very nice but when they are together they aften act too cool or like tools. But I have met plenty of friendly ones.
"Registration Process – If you know exactly what major you want to get into then it is pretty simple to get into the classes you need for that major. However, if you are undcided, as I am, the advisors have not been the best at helping with what classes to for sure take. Also classes fill up fast and are hard to get into after they are full."
"Parking on campus is expensive and often hard to find. Parking passes run around $250 for a year, which to me is way too high to be worth it. Students can park at the expensive parking garage or at the Rec center, which is at the bottom of a steep hill. I prefer to walk or take the bus system... a much better (and cheaper) option!"
"The Eaton Computer Lab Is the Best – Being an engineer, I am always around Eaton and Learned. It is by far the best computer lab on campus. The computers are almost always open, there are at least a hundred in there. They are fast, the printing is free there, and someone is always at the front desk to answer questions, should you have any."
"The fall and spring are absolutely amazing on campus, especially on sunny days. But during the winter, it can get pretty bad. Snow storms and freezing cold weather with no snow happens a lot."
"It's There, but Not as Popular – Most sorority girls are big in to drugs, but you don't really see much of it or hear much about it. It's more about the parties at KU"
Still New – All I can go off of is the advising I have received over the last 7 months with regard to the Social Welfare Program requirements. Everyone has been great and I officially started the program in 3 weeeks.
My Program Is Ranked #1 in Region – KU has a long history of being a prestigious university with very knowledgable staff.
The Shuttle Buses Are a Nice Touch. I think it is a wonderful benefit to KU students to have the ability to ride a shuttle bus to and from campus. Students can avoid having to pay for expensive parking passes and the buses go throughout town.
"Be sure not to over eat! The freshman fifteen is a real thing! Watch out for the buffet, because it IS extremely good! Get a respectable meal plan."
A Joy. Get involved. Meeting friends is so much easier if you live on campus. Also much more convenient than living at home if you plan on doing better in the class room.
"Extremely Disappointed!!!!! I maintained a 4.2 GPA throughout high school at a very prestigeous and difficult Johnson County High School. Numerous Universities offered me as much as 32k a year. I was very involved in athletics and clubs throughout high school. Kansas University did not offer me a single grant or scholarship. . . I have applied for every possible scholarship. I intend to major in Special Education and there just aren't any scholarships availiable for hard working, driven students who strive for excellence. ."
Parking Tickets – I don't agree with how often parking tickets are dished out. . I think our campus police should spend more time cracking down on drug abuse than on parking infractions.
"Immense Diversity – The ethnicities, as well as, interests on campus vary widely. I enjoy the amount of choices I have in which friends to choose from."
Good Looking People – You will find that there are quite a few good looking women on campus and around town. The majority of them are smart and are looking for someone with goals.
"Very Good – I have never had any issues with safety on campus nor have I heard of anything going on either. With that being said, the best thing for anyone on a college campus is to take preventative measure themselves."
"Parking permits are oversold and hourly parking is high. It is possible to use the bus system for most people or park and ride from a remote location. Students do lots of walking, but it is pleasant most of the time."
"Most Diverse Spot in the State – Due to the university and it's reputation, I see a more diverse group of people than any other place in the state."
No Major Problems – Any questions or issues I have had have been explained and addressed easily.
Helpful and Resourceful – The professors help you in class and if you are friendly with them they will give you opportunities around campus/town to do something related to your major.
Drugs and Alcohol Sort of Hand in Hand – Alcohol is definitely more favored compared to drugs but with alcohol there is always a drug to follow along if wanted. Marijuana is pretty popular along with drinking.
Attractive and Engaging – Both genders are very attractive and all of them have different interests and personalities. There are definitely many social groups and interests out there. There is pretty much always going to be someone out here that will match a person's taste.
"Don't Come Here If You Want to Study – I am in the process of transferring away from KU. I immediately got involved in the greek system. Even though there is only like a small actual percentage of people that get involved in greek life is small, there presence is very loud."
Ok but Repetitive – Eating small variations of the same thing every day just gets kinda boring after a while. And all of the dining halls have pretty much the same food.
"Basketball Rules All – The football games in the fall are fun to go to and hang out with your friends. But the basketball at KU is just on a different level. College students have to ""camp"" out early just so they can get seats in Allen Fieldhouse. The basketball games at KU are something that you don't want to miss"
"Accessible Locations – Although the University of Kansas is a huge school, the campus is not too overwhelming large. Jayhawk blvd is where pretty much every thing stems from."
"Incoming Freshmen Have It Best – Incoming freshmen have plenty of scholarships available, but if you want to study Political Science or International Studies, good luck."
"Tons of Fun, but Be Smart – There are plenty of places for people to go all throughout the week, but you really have to be careful around big weekends because the cops are always on the prowl looking for stupid minors to arrest and give tickets to. If you hear ""ABC"" by the Jackson 5 in any bar, GET OUT."
Hashinger is definitely my favorite dorm on campus.
"The parking fee is expensive and there is never any parking spots available. On top of that, the tickets are expensive as well."
"About 90% of the Students Already Have Jobs Before Graduation – In the business school at the University of Kansas, they provide many career days. On these days students of all grades are able to go and meet the many business owners that come. Through these days students can earn internships and learn more about the companies. After a student has interened for the business and the business is happy with their work, many students already have jobs while they are still finishing their degrees."
"KU promotes studying abroad and has one of the top ranked study abroad programs in the country. So, with that we also have a good amount of international students. Most students seem very accepting of all ethnicities, economic backgrounds, political beliefsm religions, and sexual orientations."
KU makes it a priority to make all students feel comfortable. All the buildings are very welcoming and I've never had a problem with any of the on-campus facilities.
"Average Strictness – KU has a great balance with their policies and rules. They don't just jump to harsh, unrealistic rules, but recognize the normal life of a college student and just focus on providing safety to what college students inevitably will do. Academically, most the teachers are understanding and will tell you ahead of time their expectations. Socially, they provide resources to go to if you get in a bad situation, that will ultimately protect you, as well as promoting awareness of problems with taking part in risky situations."
OK Choices Around Campus – The places around campus are mediocre. I was hoping for more options that were healthier and cheaper.
Drug Use is forbidden on Campus at all times. The school views this as crucial matter that they're always focused on every semester.
Best Places – I think the best place to get food is in the 'Market' at the Kansas Union center.
"It's hard to find open dining at night. For students that have night classes, the'll have to carry a little snack for class."
"Need for a Car on Campus – To tell you the truth, you don't really need a car on campus. The school offers free buses to the students. They go all over the city. I normally leave my car at my apartment."
You never know the weather so you just have to deal
The off campus housing is close but far. If you drive your car its only 10-15 minutes away but if you ride the buses the university provides it takes almost 45 minutes.
"Plenty to Do – Downtown is littered with bars and clubs, so much so that Lawrence has been rated one of the top-rated college towns in the country. Many clubs, such as Abe and Jake's, are even 18 and up. Tennessee St. features some of the biggest house parties in the state. The Kansas Union features free cosmic bowling every weeknight, and there's plenty of non-alcoholic fun venues to visit, like the Cupcakery, Sylas and Maddie's ice cream, the movie theater, or concert venues like the Granada or the Bottleneck."
"IT Provides Campuswide Enterprise Technology – The computer labs in libraries and buildings are constantly receiving upgrades: nearly all computers are running either Windows 7 or OS X Lion. The campus is undergoing a huge transition to seamless wireless coverage, that is your connection will not be interrupted between buildings or even outside at campus parks."
"KU oversells all permits, so it's first come first serve (first come being an hour or hour and a half before class or work). The parking department is also a separately funded entity from the University, and is unforgiving with their citations, and oftentimes incorrect."
"Prevalence of Drugs – Nearly everybody drinks some at my school, but probably half of the student population engages in marijuana consumption, LSD, or some other drug like Adderall, Xanax, or salvia. The problem is mainly combatted by negative reception on the students' part."
"Excellent Faculty and Students – The Classics department at KU is small but close-knit. It's a very supportive environment that at the same time does not sacrifice professionalism or academic standards. The faculty members are all easily accessible, the classroom environment inviting. No complaints here."
"Gtaships Easily Accessible – Though I myself never worked as a TA in the department (I already was employed by a private school), most of my confreres did. Almost all taught their own section of a Greek, Latin, or myth class; one girl I knew assisted a professor with a 500-level History of Greek and Roman Architecture course. All the students I spoke with were very happy with their financial packages, which included tuition waver and a generous stipend."
"Wonderfully Helpful Faculty – When I was going through the process of applying to KU's Classics MA program, I was 20 years old and somewhat daunted at the prospect. Having come from a tiny Liberal Arts college, I expected a much more difficult experience this time around. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how straightforward the procedure. The program's graduate adviser assisted me every step of the way, even offering to contact administration for me in one instance. It was all smooth sailing."
"Diverse and Friendly – Lawrence, Kansas combines the best elements of small-town friendliness and urban accessibility. Within forty-five minutes from Kansas City, Lawrence offers proximity to a thriving arts scene while maintaining the convenience and ease of some of the best shops and restaurants right in the city itself. The locals are friendly, environmentally conscious, and probably connected in some way to KU. Two thumbs up here."
"The University of Kansas provides multiple pathways to get to campus. For long-distance transportation there is a bus system that you can use to commute from counties nearby (Johnson County, Olathe, Shawnee). It does have a fare but much cheaper than driving and still gives you the convenience of a direct route from home to school. Local transportation to campus is very cost effective and convenience. On campus buses are free and often go outside of campus with no cost. All buses include bike racks for those who use multiple forms of transportation to commute. There are also local and long-distance park and ride stations where you leave your car in parking lot and you ride the bus to campus. There is a fee associated with that service."
"What You'd Expect – For a so-called ""liberal"" university that has the highest tuition in Kansas, the diversity is what you might expect: there at surface-level- and perhaps deeper- but still of a certain rather ""posh"" flavor. As long as you don't investigate too deeply, it looks pretty good."
"There Are a Lot of Grants – There are plenty of grants for those who need them, less for those that have great grades :("
"I think KU is very reasonable. The parking tickets however are kinda ridiculous! Even on spring break when there are no buses running, you still can't park on campus to get to any meetings."
Quick Service – I haven't eaten in many dining halls. But i hear they are just OK. But they also have food courts that I eat in and those are pretty great and they have a nice variety. they are located in the heart of campus and in little corners everywhere
"Its a D- for Drunk and Failing to Become Viably Intoxicated With a Purpose. pubpc08@yahoo.com

I would say that becoming intoxicated on or off the campus of the University of Kansas isn't; ADULT. It's more... identity related or"
"B+ for Business Administration Is Like an a+ Without the a If You Are Crazy. pubpc08@yahoo.com

It just isn't real to receive an B+ for a Bachelors; people begin to hum; however it's better than a C which is moderate. But a B+? doesn't that"
"I Guess B+ Is for Business With the a Removed and the + Attached to the B.! UMPH. pubpc08@yahoo.com

I can literally tell you a B in any course is tough; a C grade you know you are moderate but a B? Definitely, losing or pronounced idiot. I am content with my career planning at the University of Kansas; I, intend to study abroad or take a few at other Universities before returning to KU-Lawrence."
"One of the reasons I picked KU was because it was diverse. There are many different types of races, religions, interests, and majors. Every person you meet is different in some way."
Good Food and a Variety – The dining halls all have similar menus. They all have a variety though and many things to choose from.
"Campus Life Is Fun, Gives Great New Experiences, and Is Safe. The campus is a great environment. It is not only fun but safe too. There are many things to do and great people to meet. There is a variety of things to do from going to sporting events which has always been fun to do at The University of Kansas, especially basketball and going to a museum or just hanging out outside with friends."
Maintain a Safe and Fair Environment for the Students – The strictness makes campus safe but it is also still fun hanging out on campus because the rules and regulations and what people expect from the students is fair.
"Our campus facilities are the best! I love all of the opportunities and surprises that us, the students, are treated to on a daily basis"
"There is a lot of food to eat, however, what makes the experience better is the option to dine out of the dining halls with an optional package that allows you to go to restaurants too."
"I have visited many colleges throught the program Kauffman Scholars and have visited the campus on other occassions prior. I would rate the dorms as okay because they serve their purpose but are not, to say, state of the art praise worthy."
Eager for You to Learn – Professors repeat again and again that they have office hours and are always available for questions and assistance. The few times I actually visited office hours the professor was actually pleased to have someone there asking questions and wanting to understand the material. Most professors also have TA's if you feel weird about talking to your actual professor.
"The one complaint I have about KU is parking. Students pay a lot of money in ""campus fees"" but aren't allowed free parking anywhere on campus. Parking passes can be up in the $300 per semester. There are red, gold, yellow, green, and blue spots that all have different required passes. And the busses that are included in our campus fees and are therefore free to ride are unreliable and slow. It takes over an hour to get to my apartment off campus which is a 5 minute drive. There are times that I was late because one of the busses was broken down (and with no notification system) I had no idea and stood there for an hour waiting for a bus that never came. With all the money students pay to go to KU they should offer free parking SOMEWHERE on campus, and put up-close parking as parking pass only."
Clean and Safe – All of the buildings on campus are clean and up-to-date with the most recent technology. The libraries have plenty of space and computers available for demand. The tables at the library come equipped with power strips and WiFi for laptops.
"You Always Have Help – The Accounting Program at the Business School is a really great environment for all students interested in it. The professors are usually around until you graduate and some of the professors you have as an undergrad turn out to be important stepping stones to the CPA exam. There are so many resources available for internships, career opportunities, practice CPA exams, and tutorial courses. There is a larger workload but that is only because they want you to be prepared for the CPA exam and your future ahead."
"Mechanical Engineering is a very difficult major, but not impossible. The workload is large, but manageable. The curriculum is relevant and the facilities are state of the art. Mechanical Engineers are in high demand so finding an internship is not too difficult."
"Basketball, Need I Say More? Kansas has the best and most historic basketball program in the entire country. They are ranked in the top 10 every year and in the recent years Kansas has won the national championship (2008) as well as making it to the national championship again in 2012 before losing to Kentucky."
"Depending on major/discipline the academics can be as challenging as you want them to be. If you choose easy classes, they won't be very difficult and vice versa if you choose difficult classes."
"The cafeteria is similar to most large school campuses, it will fill you but will not be a very healthy or enjoyable meal compared to some good old home cooking."
"Not Too Many Minorities – In all of the visits to KU before I enrolled there the people always said that KU was extremely diverse and I believe that they aimed this statement for the white kids. Coming from the city, my high school was EXTREMELY diverse, white people were the minority. The information given about KU was very misleading for me because I do not see many people who look like me or who I can share cultural similarities with. If you're looking for true diversity, I wouldn't suggest KU."
"Stay Away from Abe & Jake's! I had to learn the hard way to stay away from Abe & Jake's. This is the only 18 and older club that I know of in town and when they say older, they mean OLDER! The creepiest thing about Abe & Jake's is that there are old nasty men always trying to pick you up. I suggest never going there. I have found that I have more fun relaxing with my friends and staying in on the weekends."
Mccollum Hall Is the BEST – I lived in McCollum hall my freshman year and plan to live there again my sophomore year. The hall is the most diverse which is why its called the International Hall and you really get to know people of different backgrounds. This is great for people interested in International or Foreign Language Studies like myself. The people are also very friendly.
"Several of the athletic teams are very successful which makes it a lot of fun to go to games and meet new people. Particularly fun is Men's Basketball where students will camp out for weeks in advance of games to get the best seats in the house. We also boast the loudest and greatest home court advantage in college basketball, the most conference championships in the nation, as well as 5 national championships."
Delicious but Repetitive – The main dining hall is great but at places around campus the prices seem to be a bit high.
"Difficult and Rewarding – Engineering school is very difficult and arduous and not for the weary minded. It is also a difficult school to get accepted to, mainly because mathematical and science skills are a must. Most of the prerequisites for engineering classes are math classes, so having a solid mathematical background coming out of high school is a must. We have some really great faculty though."
"Good Prices, Bad Service – It's easy to find a decently priced apartment or house for rent, but often times the landlords don't care too much about fixing broken equipment in a timely fashion. It sure will make you impatient!"
"The University of Kansas is an accredited research institute which means there is always a lot of funding and opportunities for advancements, provided you go into a lucrative field. Some class sizes are very large which makes the faculty more difficult to get a hold of, but overall the faculty is very good with students. One problem is that professors' first priority is their research and teaching classes comes second."
Great Bar Scene – The bar scene is the best and the club scene is pretty decent too. Some bars have 18+ nights where people below 21 can hang out.
Everyone in Lawrence on and off campus has always been friendly and willing to help everyone!
Not Great – Tough to find parking if your planning on bringing a car. Not a lot of parking around the stadiums and the popular bars on the weekends
Downtown Lawrence – Great city with a lot of variety. Many great resturants that will appeal to any person. Great party scene overall.
"Rock Chalk! Not only are we known from the Rock Chalk chant but our traditions in all of our sports; rowing, bowling, soccer, baseball, cheer and dance, every sport you go to on KU campus is working hard to strive and preform to their best ability."
"Overwhleming Food – There are multiple coffee shops on campus, two different food courts, and a snack area in almost every main building. Just two minutes off campus as well there is a nice restaurant and several other food places to choose from. Your options range from wraps and sandwiches to Pizza hut or Chinese food."
Successful Study Areas – Multiple libraries or study areas are accessible at the University of Kansas. The main library or even the few scattered around campus all allow students to receive scholarly advice and help in a variety of subjects.
"I transferred into the Mechanical Engineering program so they looked at my previous grades and GPA. It was not difficult getting into the program, staying in was the hard part. The advisers and faculty were very helpful! Fell free to call and ask them questions--- they love helping out!"
Parking can be bliss or a nightmare depending on what time of day you are looking for parking and what color your parking sticker is. The best parking spots are going to cost you more on your tuition whereas the mediocre/ park-and-ride parking spots will mean you spend more time walking/riding a bus to class. Most students chose the park and ride option where you park further away from campus however you have buses that come every 15 minutes and will drive you to/from campus.
"Overall, I've never been worried about crime at KU and feel like it is very safe. The parking lots are regularly patrolled and there are always people on campus regardless of what time it is. We do have the infamous ""Lawrence Rapist"" however as long as you are cautious of your surroundings and use a buddy when traveling at night, you shouldn't have any issues."
"KU's rated as one of the top party schools in the country and it's easy enough to see why. There's a lot of free flowing alcohol on campus even though that there's a high police presence. It doesn't seem like enough to stem the flow of house parties, drinking in dorms or frat/sorority parties."
"The Underground – The only one I regularly visit is the Underground. There's a lot of options to choose from like Asian Fusion, Chick-a-fila, a salad bar, sushi, etc. to name a few. It gets very crowded during lunchtime so go before or after the crowd arrives! Even with the remodeling, it's very difficult to find an open seat or table."
"Financial aid is easy to obtain as long as you fill out FASFA. If you have outside scholarships, you need to communicate with the Financial Aid Office."
"Exercise Science – Exercise Science is preparing me for graduate school. I intend to get my master's degree as a physician assistant. The program is set up to prepare a person for numerous graduate programs, including physical therapy and physician assistant. The work load is manageable but challenging at the same time. The curriculum includes several prerequisites such as chemistry, humanities, anatomy, physiology, and several other subjects."
"Lots of It. There is always something to do in Lawrence. The clubs are always busy, there's usually something at one of the frats. KU sponsors lots of events if you choose not to drink. SafeBus and SafeRide provide transportation all around Lawrence, which helps greatly decrease drunk driving. Most clubs/bars are 21 and up."
"There are some cute guys in on-campus living, but you have to find them. Pretty girls are much easier to come by as freshman in sororities live in the dorms, freshman in fraternities live in the houses. Lots of athletic-types here due to the draw from Kansas Athletics."
"Completely Safe – I have never felt unsafe on campus. I have only heard of one incident of people feeling threatened, and that was when they were careless and left their doors unlocked. I have walked from the library to the dorms late at night alone several times. As a freshman girl, I never felt threatened or unsafe."
"Positive Learning Environments – There are great facilities at KU. The first thing that comes to mind are the libraries. Watson, the larger of the two main libraries, is there 100% for focused learning. Anschutz, the second largest, is also a great environment, but it is more of a ""social"" library. You can study in groups and it's not against the law to have a laugh while learning. As for the campus itself, it's stunning!"
"The computers are fantastic, the printers in the engineering library are extremely hightech and require a student to login to their account at the printer to avoid printing unncessary items. All students are given $8 worth of printing money and personal computers are needed if one wants to do work in their room. Internet is usually reliable throughout the campus and the dorms became wireless this winter."
There are lots of options with a wide array of prices from McDonalds to Steak n Shake to Applebees to Free State. There are buses going by them all day long so access is readily available and often student deals are run to help students save money.
"Housing Vs Bar – There's a couple of bars on the corner of Ohio St right down the hill from campus. This is also the location of the Schol Halls. For the most part Ohio's pretty okay. Sometimes you find a spot, sometimes not. But Thursday - Saturday it's a total pain trying to find a spot when most of the usual spots are taken by people only parking there for the bars."
"Printing for Engineers Is Great – First off, every KU student gets $8 for printing every semester. That's pretty good and I've never had to use all of it. But for Engineers, printing is free at the Eaton computer labs and Spar Library. Which considering you'll be printing a lot for reports and what not, it's really great to have. Also if you live in the Scholarship Halls, printing is also free in your houses too."
"Has a great music program, music therapy program is one of the highest in the country. Well known for basketball and home of the invention of basketball, Naismith."
"Lawrence has a unique downtown with interesting stores unique to the town. Lots of cultural events and fairly safe not enough activities to do such as theme parks, ice skating. Lots of parks for and recreational centers though."
"No Crime, University Provides Safe Bus and Safe Ride Service (Somewhat Like Taxi Service) – I have yet to hear about any campus crime. There are emergency safety phones set up throughout the campus. The university also offers a Safe Bus service to prevent drunk driving. There are 3 buses and they take different routes throughout Lawrence (mainly downtown and the student apartment areas) all the routes start at the dorms. The university also provides a Safe Ride service that is like a taxi service. As long as you are a student, you may call to ask for a ride."
Buses Available Throughout Town Along With Student Parking Near Campus – Buses are always running. The amount of time it takes to get to campus varies on which bus route you take and where you're living. Student parking is available. There is a small amount available on campus and then there is a Park & Ride area where you park near campus and bus will take you to the campus. The Parking & Transit is rather strict on their ticketing though.
"At the University of Kansas you have two choices of which side of campus to live on. You can live on one side at Daisy Hill, which house most of the dorm. Its very close to allen field house. Or you can live in GSP or Corbin (All girl dorm) on the other side of campus by the football stadium. Daisy hill is way closer but GSP/Corbin have a reliable bus system, and even if you miss the bus it is only a ten mile walk. Corbin is the sorority girl dorm. Every girl in a sorority lives there their freshman year. Food is about the same. Daisy hill has Ms. E's, the largest food service on campus, with a lot of variety. Corbin/GSP shared a food place located in GSP. It is currently being renovated but will be open in the fall of 2012. It is said to be high tech and custom meals to order. Either way you can not go wrong, depends what you like. But remember whatever eating plan you get, I will work at any of the eating locations. Meaning you can live in Corbin but still go eat a Ms. E's"
"Popular Study Areas – Everyone also assume that you study at the library. Which is true but KU has several libraries, so which one do you choose? Watson library is the best choice. It is smaller so its not so overwhelming. Less people means less people watching to distract you from homework. I has both quiet and non quiet study areas. My favorite place is the 5th floor. It is a quite study that has the classic wooden chairs and wooden desk. However, If your back does start to hurt, large cushioned chairs are always available. Don't worry about there not being enough outlets for all your deceives. Most outlet up there have a power strip connected to it. Happy studying!"
A Wide Variety of People – The university has a wide variety of race. I believe the ratio is very well evened out with the international exchange students being a bit higher percentage. They all get along very well.
My financial aid process was very smooth without any obstacles. I was able to get my grant money with ease. Bursar office was very helpful throughout the entire process. I was very pleased.
"Apartments Are Reasonably Priced – After moving from Indiana University and comparing the two universities together in terms of off-campus housing, Lawrence was surprisingly cheaper. And most of apartments are cleaner and quieter. A lot of them, including mine provides a shuttle bus ,which is very nice for stingy college students like myself."
"Not Much to Do but Great Nightlife – There isn't much to do on campus and out. But when the night comes, bars open and the Student union often open up an event. At University of Kansas, sports is a big tradition so naturally, when basketball or football season comes, its the best time of the year."
"Game Over If Rains – University of Kansas is known for its hill-y landscape. It is fantastic to look at from a far on a sunny day, but when you are on campus walking to your class, it is total pain. Add pouring water into that picture, it creates a total chaos. Mercy street."
"Good Eats on Massachusetts Street – In the heart of Lawrence where University of Kansas is located, is the Massachusetts street. The town considered on the liberal side, this one street has hundreds of different kind of restaurants and thousands of different exotic dishes. From Indian cuisine to Caribbean, Mass street will satisfy any of your food cravings. Plus, most of these restaurants are pretty kind to your wallet."
"Great Quality but Limited Menu to Choose from – There are 3 major dining halls that you can go to at University of Kansas. One at the Union, one in the basement of a lecture hall and the biggest buffet cafeteria (Mrs.E's) located in Lewis Residence Hall. The food is fantastic but students are confined with little choices to choose from. By the 2nd year at the same institute, students will most likely be bored with the menu."
Love Them – love our frats and sororities very polite and fun.
We are huge sports fans and love our men's basketball team!
"Public transportation is great. Bus is available to pick up students in evening/late at night if drinking,etc. and take back to campus or home. School has buses that run routinely through town to get students to classes."
Parking permit is costly and spaces are limited. Bus service is excellent so may not need car. Tickets are issued quickly and not forgiven. You need to get to campus early to get parking. Lots are restricted.
"Fan support at KU is great, but fans can be finicky and sometimes unfair to coaches and teams when not winning. School spirit is awesome. All sports facilities are good, but basketball is more catered to than other sports. This is a basketball school. KU has an exceptional program."
You will see every walk of life on this campus from the Art students to the jocks to the computer science geeks. But there is never any issue among these groups and many times you will see them intertwine. KU is a school where it's ok to be different because we're all here for the same thing to learn and grow. Yes you'll have the extremely religious protesters every once in awhile usually when something major political is happening in the world but the next day you'll have the extremely liberal people protesting. But once they've gotten off their soap boxes everyone just goes back to normal and no one is hurt or truly upset about it. You just feel like you can express yourself with out judgement on this campus.
"The campus alone is beautiful, full of trees and lovely landscaping. I love the way campus is laid out and the fact that cars aren't allowed to drive on campus during school hours, it allows you to feel safe crossing the street and avoids many traffic jams. The bus system is great and if you live off campus they have a park and ride system connected to the towns bus system that works nicely. There is always something going on in the afternoons on wescoe beach and almost every Friday there is some type of music playing outside of the union. It's a beautiful campus but it is a walking campus so be prepared to climb hills and walk to classes."
Pretty unreliable...2012 was the mildest winter since 1931...it didn't get below 50 degrees that often.
Diverse campus - segregation noticeable mostly with exchange students. Nightlife especially diverse.
"""Student Ghetto&quot – Surrounding campus are many different areas of student housing. The only thing that separates the ""student ghetto"" (a misnomer- many of the houses are awesome) are the hills - annoying - but worth it. There are also a variety of extremely nice apt. complexes within 5-10 min drive from campus. Pools, tech labs, gyms, etc., all available."
I'm a freshman and didn't bring a car to campus since I'm living in the dorms on campus. I usually take the bus or walk to class. They are strict on parking tickets. You can by permits that allow you to park in certain lots.
"Num Num Num – Lawrence has so many great places to eat. The best part is the variety. There are so many non-chain restaurants, which is a nice change of pace. Many great places are located on Mass St., which is just a short walk from campus!"
Campus Life – The University offers more campus activities than any student could ever possibly imagine. There is something great happening somewhere on campus at all times. Campus is also very beautiful during the spring season with all of the gorgeous tulips in bloom!
"ROCK CHALK! The city of Lawrence, Kansas is sure to have something for everyone. However, it is definitely a very liberal environment. I enjoy the variety of independently owned restaurants and shopping available on Mass Street. The University hosts several cultural events to get everyone involved in one way or another. Of course no one can deny the intensity that fills Lawrence during basketball season. Allen Fieldhouse is without a doubt the best place to watch a college basketball game and the energy is so powerful, words cannot even begin to describe it!!! Rock Chalk Jayhawk, GO KU!"
"The thing I like most about the University of Kansas is its traditions. Because basketball was started here, a lot of them have to do with that, but there are still others that are very unique. For example, it is bad luck to walk through the bell tower before you graduate and there is a fountain on campus that you get thrown into on your birthday."
"Various Libraries – The University of Kansas has great libraries. You can't walk two blocks on campus without passing one and they are all so different. They range in size, topic, and atmosphere. Everyone I have been in has been helpful in some way. I spend most of my time in the Architecture Library, which is small and quaint and a great place to study and read."
"Great College Town – Lawrence is a great city to live in as a college student. It is moderate in size, but has plenty to do. The local eateries and downtown strip are always busy with people. A lot of students stay in town on the weekends because there is always something to do. It is also a very artsy and dynamic town which also makes things fun and interesting."
"Rec Center – Pretty good Rec Center, with a rock-climbing wall, and a lot of weight lifting equipment. Try to avoid it between 5pm and 7:30pm, because it is way too crowded."
Weather changes very fast. Very little consistency.
"Something for Everyone – There is a place for everyone in Lawrence. No matter who you are, you will be able to fit in with a group that is right for you."
"My Second Home – I love my dorm: it is only a 10-15 minute walk to any of the buildings, there is a dining center downstairs, and it is across the street from the rec. center. What I don't like is that we have to pay for laundry and the elevators jam often."
"No Place I'd Rather Be – Every building on the KU campus was designed for its students. The recreational center is close to the campus and open from before dawn to midnight; the libraries are often open all day and night; and the Underground (where we get food in a rush) has many different choices including sushi, Asian, pizza, and salads. Plus it seems as if there is a different function every day and it allows students to make friends, relax, and have fun."
"Lawrence, Kansas is a beautiful town, not to big, and not to small. There is so much to do every night of the week, and the people around are so friendly. I feel comfortable and safe everywhere I go, and never feel like I do not belong. Lawrence is my home away from home, and it is the classic college town."
"Adds Some Flavor – The Greek life at KU is well-known. They host parties with different themes and people that are involved with the Greek life can be easily spotted on campus. The Greek life does a good job of recruiting people and trying to have a variety of ""brothers"" and ""sisters."" The fraternities and sororities are a big part of KU and for a good reason, they have fundraisers and encourage people to step out of their comfort zone."
Good Variety – Campus food is pretty good. The main eating establishment on campus besides the dining halls is the Underground which features a variety of different foods from Pizza Hut to sushi! It definitely has something for everyone and the other eating establishments at KU also have good variety so you never get tired of eating on campus.
"Very Eccentric – Lawrence is one of those towns that surprise people. It has a vast amount of different types of people. The University of Kansas has a great deal to do with why Lawrence is filled with an amazing amount of uniqueness. Downtown Lawrence is where all the fun happens, great restaurants, locally owned businesses and a very accepting atmosphere. I've lived in Lawrence my whole life and have never become bored!"
"Party Heaven – The kids here love to party. Since I love to study, it drives me insane! Every night I can hear kids driving by or yelling in the dorm hallways."
"A Very Diverse School – There are plenty of foreign exchange students, and tons of people with different ethnic backgrounds. I made five new friends the first week; four of them weren't from the United States."
"Off-Campus housing is better than living on-campus. The only con is that you are farther away from the University. However, normally the housing will be near a bus route, which you can take every day to get to school at a descent time. The cost is about the same as living on-campus; it might even be cheaper because you can have a roommate."
"For almost all of the school year, it is very cold here. We have buses to take us around campus but they are crammed with people trying to stay out of the weather"
"I Don't Get Any. My family is relatively well off and I had average grades in high school, so I am not getting any financial aid."
"No Clue – I don't know anything about sports, nor do I care to. I know that people at KU love sports and they have many different types if you do like sports."
"Diverse and Welcoming – KU is Incredibly diverse. If you are a bigot or a racist, this is not the school for you. We have students of all races, all economic statuses, and all religions. People here are very welcoming of the LGBTQ community as well."
"Good Times – I have found that there is a very lively nightlife in Lawrence. It is always a good time to hop on safe bus from the dorms and see where the night takes you. If you are 21 there are the mass street bars and when there are good deals people will be there. The Granada has a lot of shows come through it too. overall, if you look for fun you will find it."
"Not Bad, Not Great – I am a very picky eater. that being said, take my opinion lightly. I am also a vegetarian and they do have some options for me. Mrs. E's is a bit lacking in verity and quality. the studio is good most of the time. the market and the underground are the best but you will be paying for it. My advice?...When in doubt get the hummus."
"The Middle – KU has mostly middle class students. This is not a complaint, simply a fact. If you do not fall in that same category it is not obvious to the other students. KU is very supportive for those who need the extra help in the funding department. The Endowment Association particularly helps in that area. You can get loans from the donations alumni have given. They really do a nice job of making sure you can stay in school no matter where you come from."
School Unique – The University of Kansas is a very unique university because it's located on the hillside. The location of the University is very close to all the places such as restaurant and shopping shops.
Huge Multicultural Populace – I was surprised by the number of international students that were here. This is a very good opportunity to know and learn about other people and their cultures and they are very happy to do so.
Quite Erratic – The temperatures here can get switch overnight and the weather is very much impossible to track. It doesn't really affect classes so that is a plus. But the sudden changes can cause you health problems.
"Not Really Strict – I have found no rules in particular that can affect me or students in our academics or social lives, except maybe the no skateboarding rule. Then again, how many people skateboard?"
"Cashbar actually selling the best burger in Lawrence, kansas. The location of the restaurant is pretty convenience to student which can take No. 11 bus and straight reach the street of the restaurant located. The price for the burger is consider reasonable which is about 5 dollars for a big burger."
"Parking is simply a b*tch! On game days, the parking police are like trained Nazis. They are inconsistent about ticketing too. Sometimes you WILL get ticketed, other times, you WON'T. It's a pain."
"Revolves Around Basketball – KU basketball players are worshiped like gods. People attend the games religiously. But, football.... Not so much. Out football team is not touted so highly. They've been a joke the past two seasons. Other sports... they receive a bit of attention. We have a good quidditch team too...."
"OVERPRICED! But that is common on campuses. A smoothie is $5! It's ridiculous. We have one main dining hall because most student live off campus. Mrs. E's is decent, their desserts are good. It's not organic or super healthy though. We have a Chik-fil-A and Pizza Hut stations."
"KU's academic buildings are nice. Both libraries are accessible and open til the late hours of the evening. Our Student Union has a bowling alley and numerous other things! Our fitness center is nice, although far away."
"Can Be a Problem – once you get the ""lay of the land"" so to speak and memorize the least used parking lots you can usually find a parking spot. Try to park somewhere earlier on or else it can be packed"
"about average strictness, you're not supposed to drive on campus until most classes are over, parking can be a problem and sometimes the buses will make you late.Not really too strict.EXCEPT for parking."
"The people here are pretty laidback and almost everyone wears something with KU on it..this is a really awesome place with UNMATCHED school pride! I have visited several universities across the country and there is nothing close to being a Kansas Jayhawk..Once you are a Jayhawk then you become like family to everyone. Also,Lawrence is one of the best college towns and on a basketball night all the TV sets in town are turned to the game(if you're not already at it). Seriously, you cant find a more awesome school in america in terms of both social life, school pride and academics. (our debate team has five national championships). When you come here check out the local pizza places and the nightlife on mass street! Seriously, this place is like no other, KU won the title in 08 and Mass street went wild, the people are so passionate about basketball that its something very special."
"Multitude of Opportunities – There are so many people, groups and activities to become involved with at KU. There are always free lectures, programs and volunteer activities. You have to throw yourself into whatever event sounds interesting and fun. There are always new opportunities to meet new people and expand your resume."
"Slow and No Free Printing – The wireless access has just reached the dorms on campus this year. The speed of the computers in the libraries on campus are slow at best. It can take up to ten minutes for a computer to log on. Printing is not wireless and is not free. It can be hard to print on campus because of the lack of computers in the libraries; especially during busy hours, such as lunch."
"Secure, Welcomed, Informed – I always feel comfortable walking back from class late at night on KU's campus. There are clear lit paths from the campus to the dorms. There are usually police officers walking on campus or patrolling. It is always best to be smart but KU is a relatively safe and secure campus."
Most students on campus dress very casual. The typical student wears jeans and a t-shirt. I am always seeing very attractive guys on campus. From my experience most of the guys on campus aren't looking for a relationship just somebody to mess around with.
Lawrence Has a Variety. Lawrence has a great variety of places to eat. Most of the best restaurants are on Mass st. You can find anything from greek to indian food.
ROCK CHALK JAYHAWK!! I love the school spirit at KU. We don't have a good football team but we still support them. Basketball is HUGE here. This year is a rebuilding year for us but we are still doing good. KU basketball is the best experience I have had. Allen Fieldhouse is the loudest college basketball stadium in the country. We are 7 in a row big 12 champs and James Naismith (inventor of bball) was our first coach. Enough said.
"Food Is...Alright. The dining halls in the dorms are not so great. There is always a good salad bar but that gets old fast. Otherwise sometimes it's good and sometimes you're better off going out to eat. But the underground and union have good food. There is chick-fil-a, pizza hut, sushi, wraps and other goodies."
Our rec center is very nice. There is a huge rock climbing wall and the classes are pretty cheap. The libraries have quite a few computers but they can be slow sometimes.
"School Spirit – Something i wasnt prepared for was the amount of school spirit on campus, its wonderful and it really helps you have a sense of pride for going to KU. There is almost always a booth or table for you to get a free shirt or something else and it provides students with KU gear and also free clothes. If i had to chose all over again knowing what i do i am almost positive i would still chose KU because of the atmosphere"
I really dont know what other schools are like in all honesty but the teachers within my specific major are awesome. I am constantly getting emails on new internship and job opprotunities as well as ways to help with my workload or improve my writing. The facilities are very good and offer both quiet environments as well as some where you can work with others to improve your work.
Shops Gallore – There is a main street called Mass and there are shops and bars and jazz clubs lining the street its a wonderful place for students to take a day off and shop and have some fun. There is also an on campus gym for students to work out at or just simply play a game or two of tennis. There are also often campus events for students to attend. There is an on campus police force as well as an off campus one and all students can feel safe within the town. There is also a wonderful attitude students.
"One of the great things about attending a state university is the diversity that comes with it. There are people that are different races, religions, and practices, but everyone respects each others beliefs."
"Food Choices – There are days when the food is great, but there is also weeks where the food is similar. Pizza and hamburgers are always served, but there should be more healthier options than just the mainline."
"Know Your Permit – There are many random parking lots on campus, each with a separate lot number and permit required for certain hours of the day. It's honestly very confusing to a freshman. There are even parking permits required for the side of streets, which may be hard to see the sign. Students living on campus can only park in front of their dorms, and the rest driving need a certain permit. It's also hard to tell when the lots are open to everyone."
"Police Aren't Too Involved – Not to say that the police let everyone get away with everything, but with so many students, they don't bust parties or get anyone in trouble for underage drinking too often. They are present on campus during events and every day class is in session, and I feel safe on campus."
Could Be Better – Financial aid is a lot harder to get through the university than I thought it would be. Try as many outside sources as possible and do not rely on you the financial aid office for all the help you need.
"Houses Are Huge! The Greek houses on campus are huge and beautiful, they are quite the sight to see. However, non-greek students and greek students get along fine. There is no ""outsider"" feeling if you aren't going greek."
"So Much Fun – There are tons of things to do on and off campus. Everyone, everywhere is a Jayhawk fan. It's unlike anything you've ever felt before, there's so much pride for the school. The campus is also very safe feeling."
"BM Musicology Program – The program in which I am enrolled is unique; I know of only a couple of universities that offer an undergraduate Music History or Musicology degree, and most of those are very large music schools. I am the only student in the program here. The fact that there are only four faculty and about ten graduate students in the musicology program has given me many opportunities for research and mentorship than I would have had at a larger school. Most people come to musicology through performance or music theory, so I was excited to be able to start doing research and teaching during my undergraduate."
"Poor Upkeep – Murphy Hall (in which I spend most of my time) has very little upkeep. Last semester there was an asbestos scare, which is still not resolved. Climate control regularly malfunctions; I heard some of the custodians complaining that it took two weeks for repairmen to come after they told them the fifth floor heating was inoperative this November. Next semester the heat will be off on the third and fourth floors until mid-March, in order to drive out an infestation of book-glue-eating"
"Too Many Hills – The many campus hills become dangerous in snow, ice or rain. I do not drive to campus, but I often hear of bad car wrecks because of people sliding down icy hills or not being able to stop at the bottom of a hill. I have gotten dumped into ditches because of ice on the sidewalks; when I only have ten minutes between classes at the opposite end of campus, it is nearly impossible to get there on time in bad weather because the sidewalks become so slick."
"Limited Campus Police Presence – I have been disturbed by the limited presence of campus police. I walk to school at 4:30 every morning, and I am always nervous about walking alone through the dark. Walking back home after late recitals or rehearsals is even worse. I have heard veritable horror stories from dorm-dwellers and RAs about the situation of the dorms: drunkenness, drug use, unauthorized cohabitation and noise violations are all tolerated. One of my classmates has been waiting for three months for a simple floor transfer since the people down his hall have set up a regular 2:00 AM appointment to pound on his door and shout obscenities at him because he reported them for a noise violation."
"I remember the financial aid being sort of a long process, but it worked out in the end. I got a small first year scholarship from the school."
"Driving Safe – Getting around safely at The University of Kansas is relatively easy. Between safebus, saferide and badd duty there is no excuse to be walking alone or driving drunk!"
"The libraries have a variety of different environments to study in. From places to study as a group, to the quiet areas in Anschutz or secluded areas in the stacks of Watson there are places to fill every study need."
"Local Focus on the University – The entire town of Lawrence is focused on the University of Kansas. I found that many landlords were unwilling to rent to non-students; many stores offer student discounts. As soon as the semester (in fact, the first half of finals week is over), the entire town becomes deserted, and stores and restaurants begin to close. The locals are all friendly and helpful to the student body."
"Spencer Research Library – The main reason I decided to attend the University of Kansas was the Spencer Research Library. As a musicologist, I find it an incredibly helpful resource. The Shull Collection (in American religious literature) has allowed me to do significant new research in early American hymnody and music theory and notational practiced in dispersed-harmonic compositions without having to travel to other institutions or rely heavily on microfilm."
"I haven't done one associated with ku, but I did one for a church and it as great."
The sorority was amazing. I met a lot of great people from many places
"There are different people of all walks of life at KU. Many people of different races, sexualities, religions and still getting along as one student body. Overall it is good for acceptance and differences. That would be accepted only when not involved in Greek life."
"Student Life – There are plenty of ways to spend time off campus in Lawrence. That's one of the benefits for going to KU. Massachusetts street is very popular with shopping and quaint restaurants. If needed, Target is 2 miles down the road on Iowa street. On Mass St. then you can get noodles & co, chipotle, buffalo wild wings and many delicious restaurants. There are many delivery services to the dorm which definitely is nice. Most of them run until 3 AM!"
"Computer Life – Living in the dorms thru the school them WiFi is hardly available. Living at Naismith then there is WiFi which, is poor for the entire Lawrence area. The television cable channels at Naismith are awful and they take away all of the channels that this age group typically watches. Definite need for a personal laptop. You do get $8 worth of printing through the school from your tuition."
"The parking at KU in convient, although it is a great expence to the student. The access is close to the dorm rooms. I enjoy this parking, and comes in handy."
"Our Social Life – At Kansas University, you will have many choices in the opposite sex. Students have a bright future if they intend to finish at KU. This ensures a bright future when choosing to date one of the KU attendees."
The different dinamics at the University of Kansas are almost all positive. They have a great range of people from all ethnic backgrounds and different beliefs in religion and background. The University of Kansas is currently the best rated college in Kansas.
"In-State Shoe-In – As a Kansas resident, it was easy to apply for and get into KU. The application process wasn't abnormally long or difficult."
"Packed Lots Pricy Passes – It's tough to park around campus and it's expensive to park on it. There are other transportation options, like the bus, which is included in tuition. Living close enough to campus is advisable, because it puts you in the center of it all; school, parties, bars, etc..."
"School Spirit to the Max – School spirit is insane at KU. People do go to all the football games and support their team, but it's basketball that the school revolves around. Students camp out for every game (even exhibition) meeting 6am the morning after every home game, sometimes outside in the frigid weather. The players are treated like celebrities and the whole town bleeds crimson and blue on game days. Basketball is certainly the biggest social event on campus."
"Dinning on campus is all right, but very repetitive. If you live on Daisy Hill, Mrs. E's is the place to eat, and it's a LOT better than Oliver dining or GSP/Corbin. The Underground is a nice place to eat between classes, but can get expensive and very crowded at peak times"
"Rare Punishments – Since Lawrence is a college town, everyone understands what students want to experience. The only punishment that you would see somewhat ""often"" is drinking in the dormitories, but that's usually when students decide to pregame in the dorms and things get out of hand. They also don't allow smoking in the dorms but students often smoke right outside on the stoop. The ambulance, fire department, and police come to the dorms often but no one gets any real punishment. They just come to check things out to make sure people are okay. Police don't care much for parties, they'll come in and walk around and find a random person smoking drugs, but if it gets to rowdy they just ask people to leave. If you just drop your cup, they don't give you any consequences for drinking unless you're out of control. Most bars don't care about underage drinking. Almost everyone has a fake, or does pass backs. But if it's a slow night, they are a bit stricter. Bouncers often let you know if they don't wanna see a certain id passed back again. The University offers what we call SafeBus, which drives students to various locations on the weekend when they go out to party. It runs Thursday-Saturday 9pm-3am. The university also provides a ""SafeRide"" which is like a taxi. A student may call, or use an emergency blue phone on campus, to call SafeRide to pick them up and take them home. Overall, the city of Lawrence is lenient with students' behavior."
"Food Worth Your Dollar – There are many dining options available on campus. There is a dining hall near every dormitory. How many meals you get depends on your meal plan but the dining halls are set up in a buffet style, so it's unlimited amounts per visit. The food isn't like home but it's decent and satisfying. When holidays come around, dining halls cook their best meals, and the halls are full. There are on-campus cafe shops and dining areas as well. There is a dining area at the Kansas Union that provides various mini restaurants at a facility called The Market with food such as pizza hut, Japanese &amp; Chinese cuisine, deli, grill, vegetarian etc. A popular on-campus dining area is The Underground, which is on Jayhawk Boulevard near most lecture buildings. The Underground is somewhat a higher-quality version of The Market. It includes Pizza Hut, Chik-Fil-A, Japanese &amp; Chinese cuisine, deli, grill, vegetarian. There many other dining facilities all over campus, over 20 locations. There's really no reason to go off campus to eat unless you're going for fast food or a local restaurant like Applebee's. If you get tired of the food, there are various places that will deliver Chinese, pizza, subs etc."
"Lawrence is your typical college town. It is home to the University of Kansas(KU) Jayhawks who won the 2008 NCAA Basketball Championships. Lawrence does somewhat revolve around KU. The University often has events that are open to the public(i.e. carnival, comedians, musical performances, bowling). A popular attraction is Massachusetts Street (Mass). Mass is where the shops and restaurants are. Attractions all on one street. It's also very close to campus. You could walk or take the bus there. There are also local department and grocery stores off of Iowa street(JC Penney, Kohls, Walmart, Hobby Lobby, Target, Sears). There is also Clinton Lake, which is wonderful for camping. For students, everything is just a short drive away."
"I dont spend much time on campus, but I never see security. It really isnt needed though"
Up and Down – One day it will be 90 degrees and the next it will be 40. But that's what happens when you live in Kansas. The summers are HOT and the winters are COLD.
"Our basketball team is the heart of athletics. We have won 5 National Championships and have over 2,000 wins. There are very many KU fans, especially when it comes to basketball. The whole scene and involvement is amazing. There is just so much love in the air and everyone becomes your friend while you're Allen Fieldhouse."
"Very Safe – At the University of Kansas, there are always campus police and different patrol cars riding around protecting the students and the campus. I have never felt ""unsafe"" while walking around campus, even at night. I have heard the many stories of weirdos around campus, but I am definitely not stressing it because I am confident that KU will get the situation taken care of."
"I am not involved, but know that there diverse frats and sororities at KU. Many people do pledge and seem to enjoy it."
Extreme school wide school wide spirit thrives at KU. Expect basketball obsession.
"Very diverse food options are available, but are rather expensive compared to off campus meals. There are many places to buy food, however. It is extremely accessible. Meals are sold in every library."
"Four Seasons – We have four distrinct seasons, we see a little of verything."
"GSP Corgin – Great location, building is old and needs to be renovated"
"Girls, I think that this is the most important thing I WISH i would have known before living here.
I know when you imagine an all girls dorm, you may imagine a laid back environment that is more comfortable than a co-ed. Think again.. You should know before you move in that 99% of the girls living in Corbin will be rushing for a sorority and will form those ""bonds"" before you even move in (if you aren't rushing) If you do not plan on rushing, you are the minority and it makes it VERY hard to meet people."
"At KU, basketball is the religion. From the day that James Naismith invented the game on KU's campus, the University's team has dominated the sport. There is no way to put into words the excitement that the sport produces. Cheering on the team in Allen Fieldhouse is indescribably amazing! And though the football team is lacking, the University comes together and has a great time."
"The campus facilities on KU's campus are very impressive. There are two different gyms, both of which are state of the art. Both gyms have instructed courses, personal training services, and free equipment rentals which are convenient. The The Kansas Union is amazing. It is the mecca of the campus, offering: places to study, ballrooms, auditoriums, meeting/convention rooms, a food court with a wide variety of options from popular fast food joints to healthier options, two different coffee shops, a bowling alley, a movie theater, a convenience store, a bank, Student Involvement and Leadership offices, a campus book store, a KU apparel store, and much more!"
"You Choose – If you want to find drugs and alcohol, you can. Almost every party will have alcohol, but it's not a big deal if you choose not to drink. Alcohol on campus is strictly monitored though, so best to drink off campus. Drug scene isn't that big, usually just smoking. Drinking is more popular."
"Many Options – Too many people go to the libraries and forget that there is almost one computer lab in every main building. Internet is sometimes slow, but the IT helpers are usually available to call if you have problems (if you have the number). You can get wireless in every building. Printing costs .08 cents a page, but the school gives you money on your KU card to use just for printing, they take it off at the end of the semester though."
"New Words, Same Means. Even though the University of Kansas has let out new scholarships it is still expensive to attend to and even more hard to get the scholarships that are not worth all the hard work either way."
"Buses Are Good, Students Not So Much. I love the bus system for students here at KU. But if you are some of those that don't live on campus, still having to pay the bill seems a little too much. But as for the bus drivers I give most them an A+ for their tolerance and patience, but the students should be less demanding trying to change the bus schedule for their own benefits. The buses are for everyone the buses shouldn't chance anything for a few people."
"Unless Is Basketball – Unless is basketball everyone here seems to focus less in other sports. It is still tradition to cheer for other sports but it's not the same. As in for basketball games, the crowd goes wild and the good comments just keep coming."
"No Judgement – As far as I have seen, this school is diverse and tolerance is practiced across campus."
"Large Variety – There are many labs around campus. The main ones are almost always crowded, but there are also little labs in different departments that are very helpful and reliable. There has been one or two days where the wireless connection wasn't great, but the rest of the time, it is fully reliable."
"It Is What You Make It – The professors are always there to help if you put forth the effort and seek them out. There are some fabulous faculty here, and the classes are very informative. The class sizes vary and it's a nice place to go to school."
"Tradition, Tradition, Tradition – All of our traditions are most excellent. From our innovations in the classroom to our world famous chant: ROCK CHALK!!"
"Fall, Winter, Spring – Fall and spring are the best but the winters are super chilly. Sledding down the Hill is fun though."
"Rock Chalk Jayhawk! In all honesty KU is an awesome school. Everything at KU has some sort tradition or purpose. Even though some of the buildings are very old they are all outfitted with clean facilities, air conditioning, and the latest technology."
"Safebus Is Your Key to Friday/Saturday Nights – I love SafeBus. Not only because it's extremely convenient, but because you can hop on a SafeBus and easily find a party. Just follow the crowd. SafeBus is a lot of fun and half the people riding are already drunk.
It's not hard to find a house party where you can get a drink if you're underage. Most parties charge $5 for a cup."
"I Live in Mccollum and. . . I love it. It is definitely not the nicest dorm but I'm getting the true Freshman experience. Rooms are bigger than the ones in Hash & Ellsworth but they aren't renovated. Out of Lewis, Ellsworth, Hashinger, Lewis, and McCollum - I recommend McCollum & Hashinger. The community of Hash is amazing. I have friends there & they're whole floor is really close. Only negative aspect of Hash are the stoop kids - they can be real ass****s sometimes. Mac is awesome if you're okay with living in an older dorm. I've heard tons of horror stories about it but none of it has been true. Example: the fire alarm has yet to be pulled. Lewis is boring. Sure, the rooms are nice but there isn't much of a community because people stay in their rooms. Ellsworth is okay. It's a mix between suites and traditional rooms and has been renovated recently. Some of the rooms in Ellsworth are TINY! I don't know much about Templin, Corbin, GSP, or Oliver!"
I'm Getting My Moneys Worth – My classes are not too hard but they're not a breeze either. I'm a Freshman and most of my classes are taught by TAs. I got lucky though and they are all great. The classes I am in are small - 28 students on average - except for one lecture of 100 students (which is small compared to some other lectures I've heard of!). I feel like I am getting my moneys worth here.
on weekends you normally don't see the students drinking alcohol but you know at the end of the night they had some alcohol at one point of time. Possibly they get the alcohol from at parties or the have it hidden in their dorms. I have seen some of my peers with fake IDs so that could be a way of getting alcohol and how visible it is.
"The common interest between both the guys and the girls at the University of Kansas is spending most of their time at the recreation (rec) center. As soon as classes are over or as soon as they're done with their studies, the rec is where they go to work out and stay physically active. Also the rec is seen as a place where students socialize and meet other students."
"The diversity on campus is great, but the thing about it is that it is only on the campus. As for a resident's halls the diversity within the dorms aren't the same as the rest of the campus. While on campus there is an equal proportion of different ethnic groups, but life in the dorms there aren't a lot of minorities other than international students."
Beautiful Campus – The University of Kansas campus is beautiful. The buildings are all made of brick and limestone and they're gorgeous from every angle. The aesthetic of KU's campus was a huge deciding factor in my attendance.
"Open Minded to My Success – I came to the University of Kansas because they have great programs in Music and Biology, and more importantly they allowed me to major in both! I've received a lot of support and encouragement in regards to my plans."
The Spanish program at KU is not excellent. A lot of the professors are good but you won't necessarily have them even at senior level classes.
Lots of Vegetarian/Vegan Options – Lawrence is super conscious of the vegetarian/vegan community with tons of restaurants offering a variety of options.
"Libraries Are Great – The libraries at KU are awesome. Lots of room to study, computers, and tons of books."
"Lots of Routes, If You Can Wait – The campus bus system recently teamed up with the city bus system and now provides free services to KU students to any bus stop in Lawrence. They are very reliable, even in winter weather, and the schedule parallels class times; however, depending on the stop location, you might have to wait 20-30 minutes between buses."
"Computer and wireless availability is average at KU. There are computers for student use in the libraries and academic buildings, but not nearly enough- it is quite difficult to find a free one during the daytime. The wireless network is excellent across campus; however, the internet access in the residence halls is not wireless."
"Safety Measures Abound – The University of Kansas goes to great efforts to keep campus safe and secure. There are blue lights almost everywhere on campus, and campus police patrol campus by car and bike regularly. They also offer the SafeBus and SafeRide programs, which run at nighttime and will give students a free ride home to anywhere in Lawrence."
"Parking at KU sucks. They ticket you for the smallest infractions, the lots are always full and they are always far away from where you need to go. Walking is the best option at KU."
"There a lot of dirty hippies that go to KU, but then there are also a lot of Greek people. Frat guys wear pastel and sperries and for the most part are decent looking. The girls are a lot more attractive, especially the ones in sororities. Most everyone here parties."
"Overall we have a very diverse campus. White is the majority but acceptance is a widespread philosophy on our campus. Often when walking to class I pass by supportive Gay/Lesbian rallies that are promoting acceptance of all sexual orientations, and I receive flyers on campus that are in support of diversity clubs."
"Men's Basketball – KU has the ultimate home court advantage when it comes to basketball. Allen Field house is the place to be when the Jayhawks are playing at home. Students camp out for games just so that they are able to get seats, since there aren't enough seats for everyone. Its loud, fun, and full of tradition like waving the wheat and the Rock Chalk chant."
"This campus is a blend of many different types of people. There isn't just one way to dress, you are able to find so many different people from all walks of life that its not that hard to find some group you can be apart of."
Lawrence Food – When you get off campus you have a lot of choices when it comes to find something to eat. You can either take Mass. or Iowa and always finding something from comfort food to a nice sit down restaurant.
Bus Routes Are Great! The bus routes seem to come around every 15 minutes. It also picks up students at their apartments off campus. So there is no excuse for not having a ride here at KU. There is also bus routes for nightlife offered by KU. If you've had to much to drink they will have a bus there ready to take you hoe safely!
"In my opinion the strictness is not very enforced here since this is a ""hippie"" community people are more excepting about others feelings and beliefs."
Safe Environment – Even though I only see the campus police once of twice around campus I feel safe. The crime here isn't that bad so I dont feel there is to much to worry about.
"Not Very Diverse – If you are not White or Asian, there is little chance that you will find yourself on this campus. The black and Latino populations are very low."
"Needs Diversity – All of the eating facilities in my opinion, excluding Ekdahl's, are above average. They are almost always open, and the Underground even opened more space to accommodate more students. However, the main dining facility, Mrs. E's is considered by most, awful. Even some of the foreign exchange students agree. Beyond the fact that you are required to have a meal plan at Mrs. E's when living in the dorms, and that its meals are repetitive and reminds you of an elementary schools cafeteria, it is not so bad."
"Great Lawrence – people in lawrence are extremely nice to students, especially international students here. The sky is blue , you can enjoy so beautiful scenery here. Besides, you are quickly got involved in local communities by many programs, such the annually friendly family program."
"The computers on campus are very good. You have access in almost evey building and in the dorms. You can print to a number of places on campus including the library. The speed of the computers is outstanding. In fact, it is frustrating when back home because the computers are not as fast in gathering information. A personal computer is a must because you will do many things after hours whether it would be in your dorm room or an apartment setting. The same for having your own printer. It makes things easier but that is not to say that you have to have your own technology, if you know how to get around the campus with this item."
"I plan on majoring in Sports Medicine. The program is unique in a number of ways. First, I as a student will have to go through a rigorous process to be invited into the program as a sophomore. I welcome that challenge. Another unique aspect of the Sports Medicine program is that I will work directly with University of Kansas athletes and have to care for their well being."
"Jayhawk Land – I live in a smaller community and have fallen in love with Lawrence. My father graduateed from the University of Kansas, so I have become very familiar with this town. It is fun to visit a town that is as vibrant as Lawrence.
Lawrence is a place where its' citizens embrace the student body. Whether you are on Iowa Street or Massachusetts Street, people are ready to look you in the eye and say ""hi"" to you. The citizens of Lawrence know you are a student and make you feel like you are one of their own. Clinton State Lake is very close and my family loves the water. I know being a student here will give me the opportunity to take advantage of the lake. The town continues to grow and the shopping area to the west are very new and affordable. Also, the many diverse shops on Massachusetts Street offer a wide range of shopping from dining to clothing to arts and jewelry. The University of Kansas makes Lawrence a hub of activity for cultural events. It could be a rock concert, a singer of ballads, ballet, or an art show, these things intrigue me. It will give me the well-rounded experience that I want in my college years."
Study Abroad – There are so many options for studying abroad. One could pick from a long list of places as well as who they would like to travel with. There are different groups one can go with such as the same type of major. There are also different options of the time of year one would like to travel during. Prices are always listed up front and scholarship opportunities as well.
Different Cultures – I have never seen so many different races on a campus before. There are clubs for specific cultures as well. I've even seen classes that help students with learning English. I would definitely say there is a vase range of ethnicities on campus.
Study Areas – The University of Kansas has two very large libraries. They have maps of the library at the entrances as well as what one can find on each floor. There are specific areas for students who want to study in total silence as well as areas for students to study out loud with other students. They also provide a comfortable environment with the decorations and furniture. It's not a typical wood table and hard chair environment.
Parking Is Crazy – Professors try and keep cheating to a minimum and the police are their to keep us safe. Most transportation is 'no questions asked' on weekends but parking strictness is ridiculous. It seems that you can't park anywhere on campus without getting a ticket. You can't drive on campus at all unless it's after five. Most people get multiple tickets throughout the year.
"Greeks Are Good and Bad – A lot of people are in the Greek system and that's not a bad thing. The houses are beautiful and most of the people seem very nice. But there are people that judge others, cheat on tests, and just want to party. I have nothing against the Greeks that earn their degree but I have a problem with the ones that cheat their way through."
"I Felt Safe – There is always crime on a college campus but as long as your smart, it's easy to stay safe on campus. There is security and emergency phones and campus police."
"Lots of Drugs – Although the school tries to education every freshmen with an AlcohloEDU course, there is still a ton of underage drinking and drug use. Every weekend there were drunk people yelling and running down the dorm halls and some floors smelled of weed. No one pressures you very much and there are things to do for people that don't drink but you are a minority."
"Very Laid Back – There is a lot of diversity on campus and that shows through different organizations and groups. While there are a lot of white students, there are also a lot of foreign students as well. I've learned a lot about different cultures and parts of the country."
"Profs Really Care – The professors in the School of Education at KU really want you to succeed. They are always there telling you how to improve and what the real world is going to be like. On the first day of class, every teacher tried to get to know everyone and they seemed really passionate about teaching and shaping future teachers."
"Unless you are 21+, there are not many options for an exciting nightlife unless you attend a house party. Many of the bars on Mass St (downtown of Lawrence, KS) are 21+. There is only one popular 18 and older club."
"Here in Lawrence, KS, there are a wide selection of off-campus housing that can be chosen. Some are more expensive than others, but the differences in price is obvious for what you are paying for provided that apartment complex. There are many apartments that are available for every type of person."
"The facilities here on the KU campus provide a very nice atmosphere to attend classes, overall. Some buildings may be older than others, but there is a certain charm to each building no matter the age."
"Process Was Okay – Financial AId was very helpful but left me hanging on my books and supplies, so I had to come of out pocket hundreds of dollars."
"I have the unlimited meal plan, in which I can eat anywhere and anytime the dining halls are available. My meal deal is perfect and Im glad the dining halls offer great meals."
the housing dorms of University of kansas are somewhat far away from the college which make it a little hard to walk to class.
"Strict, but Fair – Overall, the academics are up to the student. With such a large school, not everyone can be kept track of. But, if you fall below a certain GPA, you are put on academic probation. Also, alcohol is prohibited on campus, including the on campus apartments and dorms. KU takes this alcohol rule seriously, but notification isn't sent home until the 3rd offense I believe. We also have on campus police that troll the premises in order to create a safe environment for students. Otherwise, the campus is very open and fun for students. There's not too many restrictions set that prohibits advertisement or functions."
"We have one of the top basketball teams in the country! Go Jayhawks! Our varsity sports are pretty awesome and competitive, but we're a big basketball school. Our athletics department takes care of their athletes with lots of help, management, and benefits that ensure their best experience. Plus, we have a lot of club sports that other students love to participate in. There are more women's varsity teams than men's available."
"Great Computer Access – There are many computers available all around campus, especially within libraries and computer labs. They can get crowded midday and around finals, but are usually available. The login process is fast and easy, but is known to lag. Even so, the internet speed is fast and efficient. The wireless access on our campus is wonderful, and is expected to expand even further to outside areas around our huge campus. You can pretty much connect any electronic that can handle internet to the network. Printing is available, and each enrolled student receives $8 in printing, but it can go fast. Scanners/copiers are also available."
Need for a Car on Campus – If living on campus there is really no need for a car because KU has an excellent bus system that will take you to the main part of campus where all of your classes are.
Typical Student Looks – For guys the most common look is the frat boy look of khaki shorts and a Pollo with sparies/boat shoes. The most common thing for girls is a dress or a skirt.
Personal Safety – I feel very safe when I am on campus. I never feel threatened and if I was I feel like there is plenty of protection or ways to get help.
"The Lawrence – It is a school of diversity. You can just go to this school and interact with people from all different places; as many as 50 countries from all over the world. Its setting is urban, the shopping area is very closed by so you can enjoy your free time wandering around relaxing. It also is a place for change and creativity. For example last year a Quidditch team was created and it officially became a sports club. You can start whatever you like and get together with people with the same ideas."
"I really enjoy KU, the campus is beautiful, the classes are very diverse and the design program is new but very strong and developing. I believe that any student who takes advantage of all the possible opportunities at KU will be very successful."
"The campus is well-built for walking and the sidewalks are normally well-cleaned during the winter. However, winters in Lawrence can be very bad and last year resulted in 2 snow days. The buses are ill-suited to handle the snow, especially because of the large hills on campus. Ice can also be severe and I have personally seem about a million students face-plant within one winter at KU...amusing but probably not that safe."
"The campus is well built for walking and there are lots of bike racks near all the buildings, though some are hard to locate at first. There are on and off campus buses that run from early in the morning until early evening and some during the later hours. However, some buildings are not on the bus routes and there are no late buses, which makes campus less safe for students at night. The ""Safe Bus"" system is unreliable and hard to use."
"Seriously, Everything Man – KU honestly offers an armada of programs to help you get set for life outside of college. It's like all their programs had babies with each other to have other programs, and those program babies are genetically eager-to-please beings that want to prepare you for life afterwards. There are a lot of programs that always get positive reviews."
"Mass Street Is Amazing – There are seriously so many places to dine at KU. Mass Street is definitely the place to go: it has the majority of the restauraunts, it's just one long section, they offer lots of student discounts, and the best place to check is the pub at the very end of Mass Street."
"Professors: Your grade is HEAVILY influenced by your professor, not by the actual course since each professor is so different and has different levels of difficulty, to the point where it's unfair to some students

Curriculum: too many necessary credit hours"
"House Parties – Go down any of the state streets and you will find a house party. People are always friendly and you can just go in, even if you don't know the owners. It usually costs about $5 for a cup but you get unlimited beer until the keg is tapped. Most of the bars in town are 21+ (The Hawk and The Cave mainly) but Abe and Jake's is 18 to enter."
"Dorm Living – I enjoyed living in the dorms my first year, but I would not go back. I wanted to meet new people, which I did. I did not like feeling like I had a babysitter (RA) and needed to check in whenever I came back. It is a good experience everyone should have, but not something that is needed for more than one year. It was nice to be connected to a meal-plan though."
"Interest in Pre-Medicine – The core curriculum, other than gen ed requirements, are mainly science classes. There is little flexibility in what courses to take. I have had good professors within the Honors Program, but I have had some professors outside of this that have not been good. It is important to feel comfortable asking questions and getting help when needed even if you are in a giant lecture hall."
There is pretty much no where for students to park on campus unless you have evening classes. There is a park and ride shuttle that runs every five minutes but it takes 20 mins to get from the parking lot to campus.
I am unaware of the options of Greek housing. They don't really affect the social atmosphere and are seen as party going students.
Most of general education requirement courses are only offered during certain times and usually consist of class sizes of 500-1000 students.
Class Sizes – I'm currently in the Pre-nursing program. I have been rather disappointed as some of courses required for this major have few class choices and oftne involve groups of 500-1000 students at a time.
Best of Campus Choices I Have Seen – Being from California I was amazed to see such nice apartments for so little money. They are incredible and I am looking forward to living off-campus next year.
"The food and dining on campus are interesting. The cafes and places that are not in the residence halls are very good. However, the on campus food is not great, especially in Oliver Hall, it is disgusting."
I came to KU because of the excellent academic standings and the college atmosphere. I was very pleased to see that the majority of the professors at KU are helpful and fair. The two things that are difficult about the school are the vast use of graduate students teaching and the lack of transfer student organizations.
"Make Friends With Your RA – Policies are very strict when it comes to drinking or drug use on campus or in the dorms. It had escalated to the point where police were escorted through the halls each night in the dorms if there was a case of alcohol or drug abuse. The RA's generally run the dorms so if you're caught with alcohol or drugs your fate is really in their hands because they can choose to either let it slide, get you kicked out, or call the cops on you. It's a good idea to get in good with your RA and make friends early because they'll be less likely to gun for you then. That being said you might as well do all that stuff out of the dorms because as long as it's not happening in the dorms they won't give it a second thought, they're just thinking about keeping that cushy job not being the bad guy."
"We Are Basketball – Sports other than basketball at KU are basically put on the sidelines. Football has some support and people will usually attend them for fun but it doesn't have the same kind of energy basketball sparks on campus. Whenever there is a home basketball game it's impossible to get anywhere on campus because so many people attend them, whether they're students or not. Basketball games also generate the best parties, win or lose."
"Getting English Papers Done – As an English major the largest portion of my workload consists of written papers, critiques and reading which, to be honest, is a pretty large amount of work to have to do every week, especially when you have work in other classes too. Without proper organization it can turn into a real mountain of papers that will eventually start coming down if you don't take care of everything when it needs to be done. The English Department at the University of Kansas is a well established program with many facilities, such as the writer's corner located in every library, available to English majors as well as any other student looking for an ideal writing atmosphere. These places are great for getting a lot of work done at once and have been a godsend when I can't concentrate on my schoolwork at home. The curriculum has a variety of choices all leading to success in the major. Students can choose to focus there studies on their strengths or refine some neglected practices in the art with options ranging from creative writing to Shakespearian literature. The student advisors in the English Department are available on a regular basis and are extremely attentive to students with a real interest in their major. Many of the advisors are also professors so their availability is really important when it comes time to get some revisions done and they're aware of it. The campus newsletters and newspaper is a great way to explore the writing field and a step further would be to participate in the numerous writing contests or scholarship programs offered by the department."
"None Available – If you want money from the University of Kansas, don't hold your breath. Unless you have severe financial aid, you will not receive scholarship or grant money. You may receive loans, however. To perhaps get some scholarship money, you must contact your major's department."
"Good but Slow – Transportation through a bus system is great to have on campus, but our university system is intertwined with the city system. This makes the bus routes long and some very slow. They are great to get around, just not if you are in a rush."
"So Many Options – The University of Kansas is very diverse in its academics. It is known for a few specific majors, but other major options are all still highly regarded. I am able to take all the classes I need, though I believe there are too many general education requirements. Some professors are much better than others as well."
"Greek life is very strong at KU and nearly dominates. There are many Greeks involved in things such as intramurals and student government with the Greeks winning most of the time. As for nightlife, most of the bars are dominated by Greeks which makes for an awesome time and environment!"
Down on Mass Street there are tons of bars and places to eat. You can use Beak em' Bucks at most places as well which is very convenient!
"Although I have not been admitted to the business school of KU yet as the application process does take a while, my pre req have all been great classes with interesting and engaging teachers. The workload really isn't that much and the TA's and professors are always willing to help!"
"Constantly Changing – The weather in Kansas is always crazy. We vitually do not have a fall or spring and the temperatures vary weekly and sometimes daily. Since campus is located on such a large hill, there is always a lot of wind when walking to class. When the weather is nice everyone hangs outside of Wescoe Beach and enjoys the sun."
Pretty Attractive – In Lawrence you will find all types of people that definitely have their positive attributes. The girls are always well dressed and blondes tend to dominate the campus. So many beautiful people walk campus that it is impossible to go to class without seeing someone that catches your eye.
Plenty of Resources – There are opportunities all around campus to meet with advisors or faculty that specializes in an area of study. The courses are challenging but the professors and TA's are always available for extra help and tutoring. Even in large lectures participation is encouraged and keeps you involved in the material.
"Pretigious Degree – If you seek a career in the medical field the University of Kansas is a great school. It has a history of producing successful scholars. The curriculum is a bit harder so your degree is weighted more. However, it is tougher material, and the professors are strict."
"Being located in the middle of the U.S., KU does not have as much diversity as other universities on the two coasts. However, KU still has a decent amount of foreign students and the student body is not as heavily concentrated with white students as others would think. There is even a great studying abroad program here."
"Great Campus – The facilities on the campus at the University of Kansas are all of high quality. The dorms are all very decent, with over half of them recently renovated. The dorm I am in even includes music practice rooms and sewing rooms. The campus is beautiful itself, not to mention the great activities that it hold. There are many activities, ranging from athletics to academic competitions, that takes place on campus. Having one of the most consistently great basketball team in the nation playing in the Memorial Stadium on campus, KU is a great campus for its athletics."
"Great University – I chose University of Kansas for its amazing engineering program. I have heard great things of the program through many older friends that are currently enrolled in the program. Many of the professors that I have spoken to or contacted are all very eager to help. Furthermore, the tuition is very low compared to other universities with this level of engineering program. This campus able to hold such a large student body within a decent size college town, Lawrence. This gives me the chance to meet many new people without getting the crowded city feel."
Wide Range of Degree Options – There is a huge variety of degrees and educational paths to choose from at KU. Something for everyone. A big campus but it embraces you.
"KU is one of the great colleges in America. Situated in a down home small town of Lawrence with tons of shopping, dining and activities to do in your free time. The education you will get here is limited only by your own motivation. A tough school if you choose correctly and a well rounded set of classes to choose from."
"The availability of computers and wireless networks is very good. There are a number of libraries on campus as well as individual labs where you can gain access to a computer. Printing at the libraries is also available. For laptop users, wireless is available in every building and there are a lot of nooks where you can park it to get a bit of extra computer time on your own."
Zero Tolerance – Campus no drug policy is pretty strict. If they catch up with it you go before a council in the dorms and they usually move you out. Drinking is far more common on and around campus.
Safety from Academics to Parties – I was very impressed that the university provides the busing services that can take you home after parties. While colleges would like to think they can keep their campuses dry- they are smart to provide a resource that students can fell comfortable taking to get them home safe after a celebration. Safe Ride accomplishes that task.
"You Know You Are a Jayhawk- Everyone Is – This college town is very proud to be associated with the university. There is a mascot on every light post. The spirit of the campus is alive from the modern city part of the area to the quaint older downtown entertainment district. Its impossible to refute the fact that you are a Jayhawk when you step on campus. When you can see the towering flags on the English building from interstate 70, you know you are entering Jawhawk nation!"
Laid Back – As long as you are cooperating with the officers you won't have any problems and they are usually helpful.
House Parties for Under 21 – House parties are not always reliable but easy to find if you are in the right place. Bars are more frequented by people 21 and up but there is Abe and Jakes for anyone 18 and up.
Simple With Great Networking – The dorms are right next to each other and the social network is great so living on campus is a great way to make new friends
There are lots of local restaurants along with chain restaurants. A great variety for any taste or budget.
"If you meet financial need you will get plenty of scholarships and aid. However, if you aren't need based you have the options of getting scholarships from your specific school which is nice. Just participate and have activities that look decent."
"Great Academics, people are always nice (Kansas Friendly), we have usually a fantastic basketball team. Great overall atmosphere."
Fairly Visible – There is plenty of drinking...enormous amounts. Partying thursday through saturday for the most part. Weed is also fairly popular as I smell it fairly often.
"Network Is Good, but Slow – The computers and the network itself and the amount of scanners, and pre-installed programs for students is very good at KU. However, the network login can be very very slow much of the time, which results is a rather problematic situation for students trying to get papers off in time."
"Buses Unreliable – When it snows, buses don't run to my dorm...and parking and transit doesn't inform us about it. I was late to class at least 3 times because of it. However, the bus system is a good idea. If the schedule were followed more closely or revised it would be much better."
"As with any school, parking can be an issue. My only suggestion would be to make all campus resident parking permits the same color."
"Sports Are Supported by Tradition – No matter what the sport, the University of Kansas students rally behind the teams. The fact that the has school-specific traditions, such as waving the wheat, give sports events an originality and uniqueness that makes going to events ten times more fun for non-athletes. Sports bring the students together, creating a bond as strong as a family's and making the sports scene at KU unlike any other in the country."
"Weather is typical of the Midwest region of the United States, especially during the winter and the spring. Weather is mostly cold but not too frigid during the winter. Spring is rainy with weather varying between snow, rain, and cold, and a mix of any of these."
"Mostly Repetitive – Too many fast food options when one is on campus. Eating at the Kansas Union or The Underground is quite expensive, with mostly unhealthy food options, such as the Pizza Hut station. The dining hall hours for dinner are limited to about 2 hours."
"Its Great to Be a Jayhawk – I mostly chose KU out of convenience, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Everyone is so excited to be a Jayhawk."
"KU has been upgrading most of their facilities, and the ones that have been done are amazing. Classrooms/building that don't have upgrades yet can feel a little lacking, but they are working on them. The libraries are amazing,truly a great resource. And there is always something to do."
"Fun, Accepting, Open – The city my campus it located in is beautiful, and full of very accepting people. There aren't too many specific attractions but it is a college town so pretty much everything is aimed at students. Its this little piece of safe haven from the rest of the state."
"Gay, Straight, Foreign, American, Male, Female, Weird, Normal, Short, Skinny, Fat, Tall, Whatever! - The University of Kansas has them all. Nobody and everybody is out of the ordinary here."
"Endless Possibilities – Whether you wish to live with eighteen other people and share one kitchen or live solo, Lawrence has it all. Off-campus housing is a huge market for the city of Lawrence, so no matter what you're looking for you will be able to find somewhere that suits you fairly well. Although many of the better housing options may be a little ways off campus, Lawrence is a relatively small city and most of the major complexes offer their own buses to shuttle you to the university bus routes or directly to the campus."
"Extremely Diverse Department – The English department is absolutely filled with highly intelligent, skilled, and published professors. The workload as an English major is as expected, quite a bit of reading and writing. It is all worth it though, the things you learn from the staff at the University of Kansas are invaluable. The entire department is quick to help when a student is in need of an internship, reference, scholarship, or any other personal matter. If you work hard for them, they will return the favor."
"A More Open Area – Drinking is a very common thing to see. Drugs don't see to seem to be an issue but the drinking issue isn't that bad, because it is contained."
"Well, whenever you wanna go out and party, you can! So get out there already"
Just a Bunch of Friends – The campus is a great environment to experience. Everyone is accepting and loving. It's a very supportive group.
"Kansas is renowned for it's athletic program in basketball. From a road named after James Naismith, to it's impressive basketball stadium in Allen Fieldhouse, to it's avid local die-hard fans including both the students, faculty, and even business owners and employees, the love for our team is apparent. Businesses will often have a TV playing a game that's on or feature a special depending on our performance in the most recent game. Aside from basketball, Kansas University has renowned programs in Medicine, Pharmacy, and Law. Many chapters of Greek life cater to these and other profession choices in order to aid the students towards their goals, and there are many student or peer led programs to help other students with their classes. Many of the professors are leaders in research and development of their specialties and much of the equipment and services are state-of-the-art on campus. Our recreational center has been cast on ESPN demonstrating alternative energy usage, and Kansas University is frequently voted as one of the top most beautiful campuses in America by several review sources. The student body is by and large helpful, friendly, assertive, and dedicated. The campus offers plenty of student activities through the union and the separate housing arrangements, and plenty of resources to help."
"Prominent, but Not Stereotypical – Greek life is prominent at KU. I wouldn't classify it as a dominating social factor though. There are many people in fraternities or sororities, many people opposed to the concepts or houses, and many indifferent. There are definitely times where it is used as an icebreaker in social events, or even in classrooms with other students. There are more than 50 houses available, split up into several councils should an individual be interested in joining. These can come down to profession-driven ones as well with certain academic concentrations being a major factor. There are some negative connotations about fraternities and sororities by some of the student body, but the general population is indifferent or supportive if they're not involved."
"Many people bring their own laptops on campus. If you want to use your own laptop or other wireless device, the network covers the campus and all you need is your online ID and password. Guests can access a separate network, but with decreased bandwidth and more limitations. On the rare occasion when I didn't bring my own laptop to school to the libraries or the labs, I used the computers provided by the schools. They are effective and the internet speed on campus is very fast and powerful. That being said, during periods where students flock to every available computer, be prepared to either have your own computer handy or grab one when you can. Most of the time, however, there are plenty of computers to go around, and the wireless speed is sufficient for either situation. Printers are provided in the labs and libraries, with a minimal charge after an initial number of pages. If you already have a computer and printer, bring them just so you don't have to solely rely on the campus equipment. If you don't have one or either, neither are going to cripple you. The devices provided are more than adequate."
"Strict Policies but No Action – There are many speeches and fliers at the beginning of the school year about drugs and alcohol and the punishments involved. But, I have never seen anyone get caught. So, most people don't worry about getting caught and do whatever they want."
"Great School to Attend – The school is a very welcoming and easy to attend and to feel comfortable, I am very shyu and have truely enjoyed the classes the the other students I have met. This university lets every one feel at home and welcome."
"Parking on campus is very limited and there is a fee to park and then you must take the university bus to the class. The dorms are also far away from the actual classrooms. Fines are expensive and they do now forgive any. There is no actual parking oncampus, it is a closed campus and you must park on the outskirts and pay and then take the bus to class."
"Buses Are Very Available – The buses are usually available for your convenience. My only complaint would be that sometimes it takes a long time for them to arrive, however they are very prompt at the on-campus dorms"
2008 National Champions – The title says it all. Sports are a big deal at the University of Kansas and all the students get really in to the games. Especially basketball since we are one of the top ranked teams in the country!
Mass Street Has Everything – There are alot of dining options on mass st. Ranging from casual quick dining to nice restaurants like Freestate which are nicer.
"Living in the all girl dorm provides convenience to campus and night-life activities within walking distance. It is newly renovated, even though the dining food isn't too yummy, it still provides a good social and studious atmosphere."
"Athletic Centers – I have used the facilities and they are really good. There are different gyms within the facility to put on basketball scrimmages, hockey, volleyball or whatever your preference may be. The exercise equipment is very beneficial and some even have mini TV's attached to them that you can watch channels of your choice on when working out."
Fairly reasonable. English professors are more challenging.
"Our Own House – Many individually owned houses for rent, close to campus."
The campus and surrounding activities are very electric!
Nice for the Most Part – Classes are never cancelled which is frustrating for students who live off campus. Those who live in the dorms have to leave for class extra early because buses are almost always full.
I don't go to the KU campus enough to know how well the security is there. For a popular school and well organized facilities I'm sure it is very important to them to keep their students safe
Being an out of state student I had hoped for more aid but KU is so worth the cost.
"depending on the area, security can be strict. The local bar scene is usually crawling with cops. Campus police does a good job at keeping things under control."
"The University of Kansas isn't a big scholarship granter, so looking elsewhere is a must! I only got a few scholarships outside of school so I had to apply for loans. KU does have a good loan program though! Plan ahead for what you need you end up paying out of pocket the differnce - not fun!"
"Venturing Off Campus for a Mean? If you're not wanting to eat the meals at the campus dining, try one of the dozens of other places in Lawrence! Driving down Mass Street one will see plenty of restaurants, such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Buffalo Bob's Barbecue, and more but there are plenty of other restaurants to eat all around town! Of course there are those quick fast food places but there are also my favorites: Steak and Shake, Five Guys, Jimmy John's and 23rd Street Brewery! There's always something good cooking in Lawrence, no matter what time."
"Driving through Lawrence, one will almost surely recognize it as a college town. With friendly restaurants, plenty of shopping around the famous Massachusetts Street, educational attractions at the museums on campus, and tons of activities going on at the Union (such as Free Bowling, cheap movies, social events, and much more!). There is plenty of opportunities to get involved with the community, events from ringing bells for the Salvation Army to serving/cooking food at the local Soup Kitchen. Lawrence is a very friendly town, where students are apart of the community and work with other citizens to maintain an enjoyable city!"
"It takes awhile to get through the process of it all...but if you have a small department with lots of money like I did, then you might strike gold...almost literally."
Pretty Good – There are so many hills ice and snow can cause problems. But classes never get canceled because of snow.
Very Liberal – Very unaccepting of Christianity and major leans to anything morally questionable. Very free thinking and actions.
"KU is the perfect balance of fun and seriousness. There is a ton of nightlife here, but theres also a lot of people in the libraries at all times. So many groups to join. Tons of activities and friends to meet."
Take the Bus – Don't waste your time with parking passes. There are tons of bus routes and they're free.
"Repetitive but Yummy – There are not a ton of options, but the food is good."
"Have Not Seen Signs – do not feel that drugs are very prevalent, at least in my peer experience"
"This course load is very competitive and prestigeous. Workload is tough at times, but I Love not having to share my studio desk with others and the environment"
"Bus Vs Car – The busing system for campus is great. It covers most of town in a relatively short bus ride. However, the farther from campus you get, the less often the bus comes by. However, there is not nearly enough on campus parking and it is very expensive to buy a permit and the parking attendants ticket consistently."
"Housing is very easy to come by in Lawrence. It is a bit pricy, considering the size of the town, but they are very close to campus. The new integrated school/city bus system makes living off-campus a viable option for students."
Basketball the Best Tournament Ever~! Anybody can Join varsity sports and have fun~! There is no professional experience needed to join different variety sports; and I believe University of Kansas has the best sport and workout facilities compared to other schools in Kansas. Basketball tournament is the biggest sport event in Kansas University.&nbsp;
"Feels Like Leaving in a Nunnery – As soon as you enter any classes, the first thing you'll notice will be ""Where are the guys?"" Out of 100%, I believe the population of the girls at KU is 80%! However, the girls are very good hot like Angelina Jolie and pretty as well.Interest of every student is diverse, but majority of students are involved in sports. Especially Basketball tournament is the biggest hit in our school, and it is easy to make friends because they are very friendly and there is thousands of different club or organization you could get involved with."
"In Kansas University, there are Computer labs every school buildings and liberties which KU students have free access to; and each lab has laser printers. However, with fast WiFi, speed of 100.00mbPs, majority of students prefer using their own laptops, and prefer to have their own printers in their home because they don't have make a trip to computer lab every time they have to print something. It saves time."
"The University of Kansas is a school that honors tradition. One tradition at KU is the Bell Tower. It is said that if a student walks through the Bell Tower before he/she graduates that student will not graduate in four years. Many student believe this curse and stay far away from walking under the Tower. We also used the Bell Tower during KU football games in Memorial Stadium. Every time the Jayhawks score a touchdown the Bell Tower goes off and the crowd goes wild. Another tradition at KU is our Rock Chalk Chant and the tradition of basketball excellence. Within the walls of Allen Field House are memories of many basketball wins for the Jayhawks. During the final seconds of a winning KU basketball game a chant from the student section erupts. ""Rock Chalk Jayhawk KU!"" The entire stadium vibrates with the sound. The players, the coaches, even the press cameras can here the erie chant. The University of Kansas is proud of it's many rich traditions."
"At the University of Kansas we have a whole area dedicated to student housing. The area is called Daisy Hill. We have 5 residence halls named; Templin, Lewis, Hashinger, Ellsworth and McCollum. Usually freshmen live in the dorms but they are open to anyone. McCollum residence hall holds over 900 students and is open year round for KU's many foreign exchange students. For upperclassmen who want to live on campus we have Apartment Style housing. These are called Jayhawker Towers. Many star athletes live in these apartments as well as upperclassmen. The University of Kansas provides its students with many different places to live and study."
"The University of Kansas has a vast amount of student facilities on campus. Our Student Union is always hosting an event for students. From poster sales to early film screening, the Student Union has it all. Also an important resource for students are KU's various libraries. We have different libraries depending on the main subject matter of the information. Watson Library however, carries the general information for English classes and Majors. Our athletic centers are always busy here at KU. Our student Recreational Center is never empty. Also our Sports Education building is full of classes for students to take to maintain a healthy life style. The University of Kansas has a wealth of facilities for students to use."
"Pot Paradise – Depends on your scene, but drugs are quite common in Lawrence, KS, especially the Devil's Lettuce. Not a big deal if you do drugs, not a big deal if you don't. Every freshman is required to take an online Alcohol Education course that touches on drug use and smart decision making. Alcohol is far more popular, however."
"Not a Greek – Greek Life is quite prevalent at KU, but for the non-Greek, it does not have to affect them. Certain Greek houses have reputations and are therefore stereotyped, but not all Greek houses are seen as bad. Some are just seen as ""better""."
"Beer Booze and Alcohol – There are parties every night. Even during finals week. Harder partying starts on Thursday and goes through Sunday morning. There are dozens of bars right off campus and in downtown. The Granada and the Bottleneck have gigs every weekend. The Granada books gigs as small as local bands and as big as M.I.A., Lily Allen, Tech N9ne, etc. They also hold black out raves on occasion. There are many places for underage people to go and dance like Abe and Jake's Landing. Transportation- KU provides a volunteer-based SafeRide and SafeBus for free to any students who call to be picked up. For the non-drinking student population/Christian population, there are numerous Christian houses in the Student Ghetto that host dry parties. These usually involve dancing."
"The Hawk Scene – The guys and girls of KU: you will get different types of girls and guys, you have your preppies, geeks, socialites, party goers, quite and shy types. All the guys and girls are pretty much cookie cutters especially the girls, blonde, big glasses and tan. It is fun to watch how people act for me, and for the most part the students of KU are fun."
"Top Notch – The athletics are the University of Kansas are top north, the creme of the crop, the best of the best. They are not only outstanding athletes but have great fans, amazing support, grade A facilities, and are greatly involved within community service around town."
"All Around the World – Diversity on campus can be compared to telling 100 different people in every country to come to one place to congregate. There are people from every end of the globe within the campus atmosphere. The only challenges faced are when communication is at a minimum, but I think it is great and allows for growth in all students."
"Full Meal Deal – The off-campus dining options seem to never end. They have a large variety of different ethnic foods, as well as your average hole in the wall pizza. KU cards can be used in a large amount of the restuarants, so the prizes are always afforadable! I don't have one favorite, which is why it is so easy to not go to the same place everyday!"
"It is best for you to have your own PC for studies. The labs are good but not allways available, especially during peak times. Network is very reliable though."
"L-Town Life – Lawrence, KS is one of the best places in teh nation to go to school. It is a well recognized school, for both acedemics and sports. A lot of pride and leadership have come from this university and it is reflected in the culture and vibrance of the students."
"Good Shuttles – The shuttle buses on campus are very convenient and are free with your ID card, but don't really run later at night. There is also free cab service if you are drinking called Safe Ride."
"Pretty Loose – There is a lot of partying off campus and a lot of people get away with a lot of stuff. It is a pretty big party school so it seems like maybe there is too much for the police to handle sometimes, and you can usually get off without getting into too much trouble."
"Freshman Year – Living on campus my freshman year was a lot of fun. Naismith hall was a great location for me because I played on the soccer team and it was located very close to the soccer field and the weight room and fieldhouse. The food in the cafeteria was not all that great, but it was a great place to meet friends and socialize. Plus there was a lounge area with a big screen TV right outside the cafeteria to hang out and meet people. The campus also has it's main parking area right by Naismith which is convenient and all classes are within 30 minutes walking distance."
Parking on campus is hard to come by during the week. You need to get there early to even get a spot otherwise you park off campus or pay. Parking permits are pretty pricey considering you aren't guaranteed a spot.
"Decent Options – There is a wide variety of apartments in Lawrence. You have your high class looking apartment complexes that are fitted with pools, work-out rooms, basketball courts, volleyball, grills, and come furnished. Those apartments usually come with all utilities included but are the most expensive. When you're paying campus fees for the rec and a pool, paying for one in your apartment for $400+ is a waste. The apartments look nice but are the most expensive. Then you have housing that are located in the area know as the 'student ghetto'. Those places vary substantially on price because of how close your are to campus, downtown, and the stadium. Those closest to all three pay the most for location. The pros to living in the student ghetto is the location. You're about five minutes away from everything. The cons are that it's completely crowded with students so parking is a problem, vandalism is high. Finding a cheap apartment is all about research and looking around."
"Great Food All the Time – The places on campus to eat are in great locations and very easy to access. There is a lot of variety from quickly made wraps and salad bars, to the fast food joints. There is also various coffee stands around campus for the quick bites of food that you need. The only thing that is difficult is the underground food area. During peak times, the underground is completely full and there is no way of getting a seat without waiting half an hour. Besides that, there is always something there for anyone. They even provide microwaves for those who brought their lunch from home. The eating areas on campus are very accommodating to all the students!"
"Parking & Security – It is near impossible to park on the Lawrence Campus. Even when a parking permit is obtained, rather than checking their database to verify the fact or ticket you, they will IMMEDIATELY TOW YOUR CAR. Their administrative staff may say one thing, but the parking patrol must get a commission or secret joy to make your life hell. When you believe said vehicle has been stolen since you had a parking permit, you can't get hold of security after 5pm. Jumping through hoops, stranded in 100+ degree weather, hitching rides from strangers to get to the lot they towed your car to was not something this experienced 50 year-old woman enjoyed and IS NOT something I would EVER want to subject my child to. Things have sure gone even more downhill since my son attended at the Lawrence campus. He always had horror stories to tell, but lived off-campus and rode the bus. In the end, he was not even proud enough of the school to attend his graduation."
"Edwards Campus Is Great – Edwards campus is a wonderfully welcoming facility with comfortable, well-lit meeting facilities, an accessible library, and a secure parking area.
Lawrence is not."
"Closed Down After 5Pm – Whne my class dismissed at 5pm, I discovered my car was gone from the parking lot at Lawrence Campus. No numbers are posted outside for an emergency and after returning to the building and looking online, it was nearly impossible to locate a number to call. Locating a possible number in an obscure corner of a page, even then I had to go through numerous voice prompts. Perhaps this is why crime at KU has gone up dramatically the last couple years."
Had a Good Reputation – I chose KU because it had a good reputation for quality professors and courses. Ninety-five percent of my classes have been at the Edwards Campus which is absolutely wonderful especially for a non-traditional student. The two classes I've taken in Lawrence have been academically enriching but the staff there like to make your life hell whether you're a young student entering academia or the older non-traditional student.
"A Place for Everybody – At KU, there is a place for everybody. The athletes often hang out in Allen Fieldhouse, there are all kinds of frats and organizations for people. Rush week for sororities is a huge deal on campus and all of the girls rushing parade around the campus fountain and stand out in front of their houses. There are opportunities for athletes who were active in high school to come up to the university and join a team as a walk on!"
"It can get pretty cold, but the buses are free and run on campus all day into the evening. School is rarely canceled even due to the snow... but the buses are heated. Warm weather is amazing for campus life. Everyone hangs out on Wescoe Beach and some people draw works of art across the sidewalk with chalk, and vendors come out sometimes and give out food, coffee, all kinds of stuff"
I Would Advise You to Go to School and Study – There are a ton of house parties open to anyone but are always being raided by the cops because the open parties are on a common street. The bars are pretty strict on underage admittance and drinking. Undercover cops are often present.
Not Too Strict – I don't think it is too strict by any means. I think it is as strict as it needs to be to keep order and safety of the students and faculty.
"Domination Station – KU is VERY Greek oriented. I believe they have a lot of control over the campus and offices held. I,personaly, am not especially a fan of the Greek system at KU. But, I would say for the most part Greek and non-Greek people get along well."
"Perfect College Town – Lawrence is the perfect college town. It's not too big, but not too small. There are a lot of things to do in and around Lawrence. A lot of people like to venture 20 or 30 miles to Kansas City, where there are a lot of attractions, especially shopping centers. The town is electrified with school spirit and really is a great place to be."
"The weather in this college town can change in five minutes! It's a great place to experience all the seasons and the beauty nature holds. As the boy scouts would say, ""Be Prepared"" with the proper attire when heading out the door to class!!"
"Unique Money-Saver, Parents Will Love It! KU offers a four-year tuition compact, so the amount per credit hour will not change for all years you remain enrolled. Tuition rates go up yearly, but increases have no effect once you are locked in at a certain rate. It only lasts for four years though, so graduate on time!"
"Mrs. E's – Mrs. E's is the biggest campus dining facility on campus, and the one that I visited daily. It has lots of options, and even when nothing looks good, there is always something to eat. They have special events that are very cool and probably took a lot of time. Mrs. E's is also a really good place for an on-campus job, they hire tons of students."
"Parties usually require a $5 charge for drinks, but it can be worth it. They are usually pretty full of diverse people too. There are lots of bars and clubs on Mass St. where people like to go to."
"Lawrence is a pretty liberal city so the students are diverse--gay, lesbian, straight, black, white, Asian, whatever. Everyone's pretty fit; there are quite a few bike riders in town and on campus. Everyone's pretty laid back and nice."
"Pretty Safe and Secure – There are campus police driving around at night so if you're on campus at night you're safe. There have been a few thefts in the art department, but they're working on that. There have also been a few incidents that there could have been more security."
"Close but Not My First Choice – Ku is the closest school in my area so it made sense to go there, but its npt my first choice. I feel like they just want my money and try to charge for everything they can think of; it's pretty ridiculous. Most buildings are in very good condition and the professors I've had are very good."
The most common parking area is off campus. Buses come around every 5-10 minutes to pick students up from the parking lot and take them to campus. It takes forever to get to class and would be much easier and faster if KU allowed more parking on campus.
mainly depends on who you hangout with but like most colleges students drink more.
"Diverse for Location – very accepting of many different types of people. Not a lot of ethnic diversity compared to many big universities, but for it's location it is good. They seem to attract many students from out of the country too."
New Rec – there's a new rec center that is awesome and free for all students. they have about 7 libraries but usually are packed during finals week.
"The University is set in a really unique town, which makes going/living off-campus much more fun and interesting. There is huge variety of academic programs, all with staff very well-respected in their fields. The study abroad program is much bigger at KU than the national average, as about a quarter of the students take part in these opportunities. The social scene is very vibrant so there is never a shortage of things to do."
"There are many cool places to eat off-campus, especially on Massachusetts St. in downtown Lawrence. Greek, vegan, Latin American, Vietnamese and many other ethnic food is available for reasonable prices and with many student discounts. There are also all the major fast food restaurants and family dining establishments around town. The Mad Greek is awesome and 23rd St. Brewery is also a really good place to go catch an away game on TV."
"There are computer labs available on campus in most libraries and even in the dormitories. Each student is given $8.00 in free printing on their ID, which can be used at the libraries and labs across campus. Reliable wireless access is available on 99% of campus, not including the dorm rooms. Dorm rooms have an ethernet connection for a fee each semester, but the access is extremely reliable. Having a personal computer is very helpful for studying in the library/on-campus or taking notes in class. Having a printer isn't necessary, but does make for one less thing to worry about."
"It's mainly white people, some black people, as well as other races, but I honestly couldn't really tell ya."
"Computer labs at school are great, and network is always reliable. Wireless is fantastic. Face it, Kansas is great!"
"There's lots of hills, so when it's icy... life is interesting. Windy days = make sure no skirts. We live in Kansas: ""if there's a tornado, wait five minutes... it'll be sunny again."""
"We have everything. I was surprised at the racial, ethnic, social, and visual diversity of students that I see everyday."
"Apparently our school cares more about fancy football stadiums than it does parking. We recently just built a brand new practice field elimnating a LARGE portion of parking options. A lot of people I know strongly prefer living in walking distance, as parking is never a guarantee which just starts off your day badly."
"I would have to say that the University of Kansas is well known for having a lot of people who smoke weed. Lawrence is a liberal, ""hippie"" town with a lot of good concerts which only encourages this idea. There is also a smaller use of drugs in the ecstacy field but if you don't hang out with people who do this, you would never know."
"I came to the University of Kansas because they were supposed to be number one in special education. In my first year, the deaf education endorsement was pulled and I was left confused with what to do. I enjoyed my undergraduate courses as their was a wide range in terms of subject, class size, and professors. It made for a great combination and allowed me to be opened up to more ideas of what to do with my life. Unfortunately, as I narrowed it down to Education, advising was poor and I am currently still confused. They expect students to know what they want to do at 18 years of age but show no strong effort in assiting you further beyond that."
"Great Downtown Area – Lawrence, KS is a great little town. It is substantially larger and has much more to do than Manhattan, KS, where K-State is. the downtown area has a lot of shopping and restaurants. KU is well-known for the basketball program. Lawrence doesn't have a shopping mall, but Massachusetts street downtown and other major stores on Iowa make up for it."
"The facilities at the University of Kansas are really nice. Especially the Kansas Union, which is used just about everything. The Union is used for meetings, classes, resources, and even bowling. The Kansas Union is a great building and people there are willing to help with any problem that a student may come across."
"Basketball, Basketball, Basketball – Everyone follows KU Basketball. There have a really great team. However, there isn't much of a focus on the other sports and the overall sports attitude isn't very inclusive."
"You Get What You Pay for. Housing at KU is pretty much on a ""you get what you pay for"" basis. If you work hard and get solid grades you can qualify for a scholarship hall which houses the more serious student. Also, there are a variety of other on campus housing options available to upperclassmen."
"Safe as Can Be! The quality of public safety that I've experienced at the University of Kansas is a bit above average for a public school. I keep my doors locked when I leave and I keep the valuables in my car (i.e., ipod, phone charger, change) hidden when I exit my vehicle."
The University of Kansas offers a shuttle bus that is free to all students and facility. The buses are very accessible and run by almost all the major businesses and food.
The University of Kansas offers a lot of places to live off-campus. The off-campus living is close proximity to campus and also they have public transportation that goes through and by almost all off-campus living.
The University of Kansas offers a lot of places to dine while on campus. Students can eat at the dorm or they have the option to eat on campus at some restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Chick Fil A.
"I absolutely love the University of Kansas. Being from Pennsylvania, I did not know anyone going out to college, and from day one I made a lot of friends and everyone made me feel welcome. I am so thankful that I am able to go to the University of Kansas. I am receiving a top-tier education for my field, journalism. Also everything at KU is great, the scenery, the buildings, the sports. I would not want to go anywhere else in the country. I love sing our Alma Mater at sporting events and I am very proud to call myself a Kansas Jayhawk. Going to the University of Kansas is the best choice that I have ever made in my life and I love going to Kansas. Rock Chalk Jayhawk!!!!"
"At the University of Kansas, students have a lot of choices when it comes to parties. They can go to random house parties, or they can go to a Frat and enjoy that party. It all comes down to what preferences the students has. But there is always somewhere to go and it is very easy to find."
"Near the University of Kansas, there are a lot of restaurants. There is anything from huge chains, such as Dairy Queen and Chili's, to small local places, such as Papa Keno's and Tellers. The wide variety of places to eat, is really nice because people do no have to go to a huge chain, instead they can enjoy restaurants that were built for the city of Lawrence. The best thing about the restaurants, is that all the local places are essentially on one street, so they are easy to find. The huge chains are spread out all of Lawrence, but they are just as easy to find and get to."
"At the University of Kansas, it is not necessary to have a car on campus. The reasoning is because KU offers a public bus system that is free as long as the person as a student ID. It is a great system and saves people a lot of money."
"The University of Kansas offers computers to those who do not have one. In every dorm there is a computer lab that students can go and type up their project and print it for free. Also in the libraries, KU offers computers. Those computers students have to pay to print, but each student gets $8 free, and a page only costs $.08."
"At the University of Kansas, I get to enjoy learning journalism in at a top tear level. Every year KU is ranked in the top 3 in journalism. It is a great situation for me to be in and having KU's journalism be amazing, it's unreal. KU has it's own school of journalism, which I can enroll in later this year, that allows students to get the best education for the major. Also, since KU's journalism program is so well known, businesses come there to recruit people to work for them right after, or during, they graduate."
Groups and Clubs – there are over 600 organizations. It is a school where everyone can fit in
Rules Within the Dorms – The University of Kansas is strict on their rules within the dorms. there are quiet hours from 11pm-8am during the week. This helps keep the noise down. Residential Assistants patrol the hallways during these hours to make sure that people are being quite. During the Weekends the quiet hours are from 1am-8am. This allows people to be up and socialize but by a certain time people need to start being quiet for their neighbors connivence. Residence Halls are strict on visitors. If a person enters the building after 11pm they must swipe their ID to recognize that they live in that particular hall. If they have a guest then they must turn in a non-student ID and sign the visitor in. Within the dorms the University of Kansas is strict on their rules.
they do their job very well and I feel safe everyday
Campus Life – The dorms are fun and it is a great experience with a lot of diversity
Diversity Among Students – There are a variety of different types of people at the University of Kansas. There are preppy Greek young men however there are also the artsy types of guys. The same goes for the girls on campus. Some girls are the stereotypical stuck up Greek girls and there are also the artistic quiet painter types. The University of Kansas has a diverse group of students.
There are many different people at the University of Kansas. We do a lot of study abroad and so we have many foreign exchange students. We have sister Universities are in Japan and Germany and we have many students from all over the world. Also many students come to the University of Kansas from different states. The people at Kansas are from many different places and they all add to the diversity of the campus.
"The Rock Chalk Tradition – The University of Kansas is a very unique school. We are set in our traditions. At football and basketball games the ""Rock Chalk Chat"" echos throughout the campus. One of the best traditions at Kansas is the Bell Tower. The belief is if you through the Bell Tower before graduation you will not graduate in four years. Many students believe in this superstition. Tradition is rich at the University of Kansas."
"The drug use on the University of Kansas is generally not talked about. There are, however, always cliques who participate in drug use. I believe the use is mild though compared to other schools known to be ""party schools"". The drug of choice at most colleges is alcohol and many student go to bars and parties. However there are smaller groups who smoke marijuana. But I do not believe that students in Lawrence do harder drugs then those."
In Lawrence Kansas there are many off-campus housing options. Many students live in apartments around the city. There are busses that go to all of the major apartment complexes. For the smaller areas the students may have to walk down the street but there are many busses to transport students to and from school. The University of Kansas very easy to get to for off-campus students.
"Jayhawk Spirit – The University of Kansas is a huge basketball school. Allen Fieldhouse is packed for every game and the students are energetic for every game. However, we also get excited for other sports. There is always a huge turn out for our football games even though we are not a football school. Also our basketball team is pretty well recognized by our student body. The Jayhawk spirit is vivid in our student section at all of our sporting events."
"In Lawrence Kansas there is a variety of dinning possibilities. A couple restaurants off-campus accept student ID's as a form of credit. The Student ID's have money on them called Beak 'em Bucks, students use them for off-campus food and laundry. By using these Beak 'em Bucks at restaurants students can go to other places other then on campus dining halls. The restaurants are easy to get too and students can take the campus bus nearly everywhere around Lawrence. Lawrence Kansas is a great town for college students to go and eat."
A Great College Town – Lawrence Kansas is a small college town with an active atmosphere. The campus of the University of Kansas holds many activities such as the Relay for life. Around the town there are many things to see and do. There is a variety of great restaurants to try and many places to enjoy musical performances. Also if you wish to be in a larger city Kansas City is about 45 minutes away. Lawrence Kansas is a fun and active college town.
"Parking passes are very expensive and the lots are still quite a hike from most classes. The bus system is excellent though, and free for all students."
"There is no lack of things to do on the weekends and even during the week at KU. Walking through the ""student ghetto"" you will find many house parties, and there are several bars that are known for having a big crowd and good drink specials for each night of the week. It is not hard for underagers to get into many of the bars in town, and even easier for them to find a fake ID. Even if they don't do that, there's always a plethora of house parties to attend. Lastly, KU's Saferide and Safebus services provide every student a sober ride home."
"Campus Safety – I have felt afraid for my safety on occasion on campus but mostly because I have a habit of studying at the library very late into the night. When walking to my car afterwards I sometimes get spooked, but nothing has ever happened to make me fear for my safety."
"Thank God for Buses – The hills at KU are crazy. When it rains, a lot of kid just don't go to class. The dorms are a good eight minute walk from the main part of campus so when the weather is bad, most kids take the bus. In Kansas, it will rain at a moments notice, so make sure to keep an umbrella handy."
"Most Fun of Your Life! Greek life is one of the best things about KU. There are tons of fun frat parties nearly every weekend and they put on a ton of events during the weeks to raise money for the community as well. However, if you don't participate in the greek scene it's not a huge deal."
"Where Did All My Money Go? The food at KU is amazing. There are several places to eat on campus and at the residence halls. Everything from Chinese, salads, wraps, and quesadillas are available for students to purchase for a fairly low price."
"Born and Raised a Jayhawk – Growing up in Kansas, I had no desire to attend anywhere else and after being here, I know why. KU has a great student atmosphere, incredible academic resources and support and a basketball team that wins championships!"
"Strict With Dorm Regulations – The campus is somewhat strict regarding the dorm rules and regulations. In the all girls dorms, boys must sign in and out if spending the night over on weekends. Also, they are somewhat tough on the greek organizations regarding suspensions and probational periods."
"Resourceful Library, Great Rec Center – The library at KU Medical Center is a great resource for students. They provide numerous study rooms for students to study in private, helpful staff and an extensive list of journal databases that help with research projects and papers. The rec center provides free classes along with new equipment, a pool and basketball court. It's a nice way to ease the stresses of school."
"The Town Is Quaint but Full of Character – Coming from a big city like Miami, it was initially a shock to get over how quiet the town of Lawrence is, but after adjusting I love the quaint town feel and the sense of history."
2009 NCAA Champions – KU is widely known for it's sports program. Especially with the basketball team winning the NCAA championship last year. For those interested in athletics the choices are many and varied.
"Copious Living Opportunities – With the high amount of houses for rent, fair amount of apartments, and suburban sprawl Lawrence, KS has a variety of options for those looking for off-campus living. Although the most plentiful of those options are the houses for rent, so look into roommates."
The entire staff at the University of Kansas are very helpful with trying to help you find money for school. They also provide many opportunities to get involved around the campus.
"Hills Cause Problems – With Kansas weather in the winter, the hills on KU's campus can become very icy and not easy to provide transportation on. When the weather is nice though, transportation and mobility around the campus are easy."
There is much diversity on the University of Kansas' campus. Mostly because of the study abroad programs that allow the university's students to accept new challengs and accept other culturess.
Campus Living – Living on the University of Kansas is relaxing none the less. It's atmosphere provides for fun times but also allows for the times when students need to begin studying in a relaxing setting. Life on KU's campus is refreshing and is set out to make the college experience worthwhile.
"Ugly to Sexy – You will find all kinds of people at KU, some you don't even want to look at other you don't wanna stop looking at."
"Excellent Overall – All considered, the facilities are pretty great. The recreational facility is brand new, there are several cafeterias with at least some variety and classrooms are generally well-equipped technology-wise. There are a good number of computer labs but seeing as the student population is so significant, it's not uncommon to have to wait during peak hours."
"Healthy Except for the River – The campus is well-patrolled and I've never felt threatened anywhere in Lawrence. The university health clinic is great, very accessible. The river is unfortunately one of the most polluted in the US, however, and none of our lakes are natural so they all have murky water."
"Lawrence, KS – Lawrence boasts a phenomenal community due in large part to the university. We seem to have an ever increasing population but still manage to maintain a small town feel. There truly is something for everyone."
"If You're Outside the System, You Probably Hate It – The members of the Greek community give it rave reviews. It certainly is a great way to make friends, meet lots of people of the opposite sex, connect with alumni, and get involved in community service. However, you can do all of those things as an independent, although there might be a little more effort required. By and large, people outside the Greek community find it annoying. If you're not a fan of North Face jackets, Ugg boots, and polo shirts, it's probably not for you. While there are some exceptions, Greeks tend to be preppy and conservative and look down on unaffiliated people. There are many, many Greek houses around campus, and groups of frat guys and sorority girls tend to fill up entire bars, use their numbers to set up camping groups for the best seats at basketball games, and Greeks tend to dominate student Senate elections. The attitude toward Greeks are based mostly on stereotypes. There are many great people in the community who do not fit those descriptions, but there are enough that do to perpetuate the stereotypes."
"Whatever You Want, Lawrence Probably Has It – Finding something to do on Friday and Saturday nights is never an issue at KU. The off-campus student population is concentrated in a neighborhood affectionately referred to as the ""student ghetto."" If you're underage, you can wander Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky streets until you find a big house party, where strangers are usually welcome to come in and buy a cup. There are also lots of parties in the dorms, especially McCollom and Oliver. Fake IDs are also extremely popular, but some bars are likely to catch you (Louise's), while others are very lenient (the Hawk). There are also a few clubs such as the Chateau that are 18+. For people over 21, Mass St has a wealth of great bars catering to every social scene. There are several places with good dance floors (Taproom, Replay), cozy, literate hangouts (Henry's), Greek dominated bars (Brother's) and several places where you're liable to see just about anyone (Louise's, Harbour Lights, Barrel House). Lawrence also has a unbelievable music scene, with national tours frequently stopping at the Granada, Bottleneck and Liberty Hall, and there are a number of quality local bands as well. Most of the nightlife in Lawrence revolves around alcohol, and probably about 95% of students drink on a regular basis, but for those uninterested in drinking, Student Union Activities (SUA) puts on cheap movies, free bowling and other activities. If you really want to avoid the alcohol scene, or if you just want to meet people, joining SUA is a great idea. Liberty Hall gets lots of great indie and international films, and there are many great coffee shops downtown where you can find a good conversation any night of the week. The scholarship halls sort of live in their own universe, but they seem to have a mix of drinkers and non-drinkers, so that might be a good place to find alcohol free activities."
"Great Quality and Variety, but Pricey – The two main cafeterias on campus are in the Union and the Underground in Wescoe Hall. There is great variety - both places have Pizza Hut Express, a sandwich shop that makes great wraps, sushi, and a really good salad/soup bar. The Union also has has a grill with fast food quality burgers, chicken sandwiches, french fries and mozzarella sticks, as well as a Chipotle-esque mexican place and a gourmet counter that has a few high quality entrees, with different themes daily, ranging from pastas to asian to breakfast. The underground has a Chick-fil-a and an asian place. The quality of the food at all those places is generally quite good, and obviously there's great variety, but it can be hard to spend less than $5-$6. Wescoe has a fairly small seating area, so during the lunch rush it's hard to find a table, although when the weather is nice, the best outdoor hangouts on campus are right outside. The Union has plenty of seating and TVs, but it's on the edge of campus, so it's a little bit of a walk from most of the classrooms. There are also retail cafeterias in some of the dorms that are open late, which is very convenient and makes for a nice study break."
